        <SPAN class="subhead">The Great Divide<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        To Challenge or not to Challenge &#8211; that&#8217;s the question.  The season has just opened.  Every year in most Rotary Districts in India this question is vociferously and heatedly debated.  Sometimes the candidate losing out in the nominating committee decision is coerced to challenge.  The fight seems to be proxy war between groups backing the candidates rather than one of the candidates themselves.  It is not that that the candidates who lost out in the nominating committee decision are less deserving.  The issue is all about  a  smooth transition every year and every worthwhile worker in Rotary on both sides of the camp  must join hands and work for the movement.  Often sadly, the delight of the victorious group seems to be their ability to keep at bay people from &#8216;other&#8217; groups and filling up the district directory with perceived   loyalists.  Little wonder elections in Rotary have earned notoriety like the political ones.  If decisions of the nominating committee for a Rotary Governor cannot be held sacrosanct probably the system must be removed from the MOP.  Let not the system create more enemies among Rotarians than friends ! <BR><BR>

        A.R. Rehman&#8217;s popular Tamil movie number goes: &#8216;The only ship that does not sink is Friendship.&#8217; In Rotary, we have four ships that will help us sail around the world discovering new opportunities for service.

        <SPAN class="subhead">"Fine" is a fine fundraiser<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        The Rotary Club of Penrith in England is a tough place where Rotarians are regularly fined for even minor misdemeanours. Twenty pence (approximately Rs. 16) or more a time for arriving late for meetings, leaving early, having their pictures  in the local newspaper, buying new cars and so on.<BR><BR>
        On sterner days, &#8220;The Fines Officer&#8221; (probably related to Fagin) has been known to penalise colleagues for accepting second helpings and / or wearing  jazzy attire.<BR><BR>
        The result is a handsome amount for the service activities of the Rotary club at the end of each year.<BR><BR>
        Looks to me that this can be a great  fundraiser because most of the Rotary members I know either arrive late, leave early or keep their mobile phones ringing<BR><BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead">An Editorial Quandary<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        A senior Rotarian and well-wisher of Rotary News, octogenarian Rtn. V.V. Prabhu of the Rotary Club of Quilon, had expressed concern at many of the club bulletins carrying an editorial and an editor&#8217;s column (similar to this one) and has asked me to comment on the same.<BR><BR>
        My views are: The Editorial should be motivational and a commentary on RI activities, while the Last Page Last Word column is a critique of various happenings in Rotary and one individual&#8217;s views of events around him. The latter certainly does not reflect official Rotary International policy. It would be desirable to keep the identity of the editorial and the Last Page Last Word column separate.<BR><BR>
        It must be made absolutely clear that the opinions expressed in this page (Last Page Last Word) are strictly the views of an individual Rotarian and in no way are to be construed expressly or implied as the view of the editorial team of Rotary News Trust. Additionally it would be unfortunate if the tone and the language used in any Rotary club bulletins contains derogatory references to individuals or positions in Rotary.<BR><BR>
        Let us discuss issues and actions, not personalities! <BR><BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead">Classification - Homemaker<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        In this October Vocational Service Month, it is time to focus on the common housewife or homemaker. Rotary Classification does not include this most prevalent vocation, where the lady of the house serves as a cook, housekeeper, caretaker of the house, babysitter, nanny, teacher for her children, looks after her husband&#8217;s needs, all roles rolled into one. Each of these roles is significant as she holds the home together, forms the basis of her family and thus society itself. But whereas we are ready to identify each of these roles separately as individual vocations, when a lady does all these collectively why is there a strange reluctance to recognise her position? In this month, there is nothing wrong in recognising and calling for &#8220;homemaking&#8221; as a classification in Rotary. My vote is for the housewife/homemaker.
