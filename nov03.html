        <SPAN class="subhead">Who says Rotary is Expensive?<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        An opinion that comes up often is that membership in Rotary has become expensive. This is heard every time a request is made for increase in semiannual dues, district dues or subscription to the magazines.<br>
        <br>
        I do know my grandson&#8217;s excitement is on a high pitch as his birthday approaches, which at a toddler&#8217;s age is understandable. But when it comes to adulthood of three decades or more, the birthday bash probably becomes an occasion for fellowship (read a drinking binge or stuffing oneself with cakes, etc). A wish by the club members at the weekly Rotary meeting serves to wake one up and the others to your having reached the next milestone; and the Club President hopes that the sun will shine brighter with the &#8220;Sunshine&#8221; box richer by a hundred rupees or two. Wedding anniversaries are similarly celebrated.<br>
        <br>
        But when the same is splashed on the pages of local or national newspapers, eyebrows rise because these advertisements are probably of no value to any reader unless he is personally known to the hero of the day. In many cases this may appear to be a way of catching the eye of the high and mighty or your fellow Rotarians, for whatever reason that merits, at the expense of a couple of thousand rupees or more.The question to ponder over is, why spend (waste!) good money on a birthday or an anniversary &#8211; an event that occurs anyway with little, nay no effort.<br>
        <br>
        Here is wishing a Happy Birthday / Happy Anniversary to all the wonderful Rotarians!<br>
        <br>
        Yeh Dil Maange...  more<br>
        <br>
        Mr. P.Chidamabaram, the former Union Finance Minister said, &#8220;We need more teachers, but we have more clerks. We need more health workers, but we have more peons. We need more nurses, but we have more typists.&#8221; Should we add: We need more Rotarians, but we have more Rotary members.<br>
        <BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead">Goodness Gracious!</SPAN><BR>
        <BR>
        I received invitation from a Rotary club with the following words, &#8220; Shri&#8230;.., District Governor, has graciously consented to...&#8221;  It is not that the prefix &#8216;Rtn&#8217; which has been given the go by that is worrying me but the use of superlatives such as &#8216;graciously&#8217; that is causing concern. If DGs are only the first among equals, why use such words?  Anyway, it is probably the work of the DG to encourage clubs in their good work by participating in the functions whenever possible. The next may be a cavalcade of cars accompanying the DG during his visits. Truly political style.  No wonder politicians don&#8217;t view Rotarians differently!<br>
        <BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead">Keeping ahead of Mulayam<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        Newspapers are full of stories of the jumbo cabinet comprising 97 ministers in the Uttar Pradesh government (if this happened in cricket, we would have felt disappointed that the century mark had not been reached). However, to us in Rotary in the Indian sub-continent, this is no big deal. We are now used to having around 500 district officials for a district that has 100 clubs &#8211; a real heavy hand overseeing the members trying to &#8216;Lend a Hand&#8217; to service projects.<br>
        <br>
        I am not alone in asserting that most of these appointments are done on a quid pro quo basis to please the Rotarian who likes to see his passport size photo in print, even though the district directory becomes obsolete at the end of the year. Perhaps the Rotarian who features every year, collects the directories to flaunt them to his fellowmen.<br>
        <br>
        Some say that we are following politicians in Rotary elections. But politicians seem to be following our example in the case of jumbo cabinets. What next? District officials without portfolio? When an Indian union cabinet minister can be without portfolio, why not a Rotary district official! <BR><BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead">Population issues<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        Coming to population concerns, a heated exchange going on these days is about the &#8220;two children norm&#8221; for contesting in the Panchayat elections in India. An interesting question that arose was whether we would adopt such a norm in Rotary elections!<br>
        <br>
        This reminds me of a report I received from a Rotarian a few months ago about a &#8220;Population Concerns Meet&#8221; he had attended. His report contained the innocent remark that the meet was well-attended by Rotarians, the average age being above 50 years! It seemed that this remark showed how successful the meet would have been in looking back over time..
