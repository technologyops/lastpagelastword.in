    <B> NOW Rs 1000 DINNERS </B><BR><BR>
    While many well known politicians, industrialists, businessmen and leaders are 
    admirers for the dislike of ostentation, I have personally seen the former 
    Defence Minister George Fernandes travel in the economy class when in office. 
    Rotarians appear to have taken a liking to lavish thousand-rupee dinners.<BR>
    <BR>
    It has been reported that American Presidential contests frequently feature 
    US $ 1000 per plate fund raisers. But the Rs 1000 dinner here will primarily 
    benefit 5-star hotels and the beverages industry. The reason given by the 
    organisers usually is, the occasion provides an opportunity to meet the seniormost 
    functionaries of Rotary. Surely Rotarians are clever enough to achieve this 
    objective by other devices! <BR>
    <BR>
   Before I get the rejoinder - nobody is forced to attend, and in any case the 
   Rotarians pay it out of their pocket - let me add my opinion. This may not be the 
   best face of Rotary for the “aamadmi” ( lay public) to see.  
   <BR> <BR>
   <B>WHERE HAVE ALL THE GRANTS GONE ?</B><BR><BR>
   NOW into August : Rotarians must be gearing up to submit requests for grants. But to 
   the best of my knowledge all districts and clubs in India are currently ineligible to 
   receive any funding from The Rotary Foundation. Why ? No Rotary District has cleared 
   or submitted the required reports on the grants received earlier by all the clubs in 
   their area. One more goal for the Centennial District Governors should be to clean up 
   this mess. Clean up the augean stables in a manner of speaking. <BR>
   <BR>
   This is one piece where I do hope that my information is incorrect!
   <BR>
   <BR>
    <HR>
    <B>‘COL’ AND AFTER </B><BR><BR>
    After every budget, people flock to experts to know their opinion on the  budgetary implications. 
    <BR>
    Their interpretations only lead to confusion; as many experts, as many versions! <BR>
    <BR>
    With the Council on Legislation (COL) just over, I feel we must have as many experts(!) in Rotary 
    interpreting its various provisions, each Rotarian coming forward with his own version.<BR>
    <BR> May be a good club service project for the Rotary Clubs!<HR><BR>
   
    <B>Pulse of the club</B><BR><BR>
    Given the power, I would make it mandatory for every Rotary club to have a news bulletin. The 
    periodicity of the bulletin is left to the club. But the most preferred is a weekly bulletin, 
    as a whole lot of news could be covered without delay. A single sheet bulletin actually doesn’t 
    cost much money except burning of midnight oil by the Editor and a few committed Rotarians. The 
    club has a significant place in the functioning of the Rotary. An interesting aspect is that the 
    bulletin helps in building fellowship on a personal level within the club. It also keeps members 
    informed of the previous meetings and the day-to-day activities of the club. The bulletin can be 
    an important tool in the club president’s hand to keep in touch with each and every member.  <BR>
    <BR>

    Circulating their bulletin to other clubs acts as a good communication of the club activities which 
    in turn promotes goodwill amongst clubs. A few clubs have a website of their own which can be a useful 
    communication tool in this electronic age. Does your club have a bulletin?<BR>
    <BR>

    <B>WHO WILL BELL THE CAT </B><BR><BR>
    The Council on Legislation 2004 has raised the dues payable by the Rotarians and some flap has 
    predictably been the result. I do not believe that this alone will be a cause for any fall in numbers in 
    our organisation. <BR>
    <BR>
    The fact remains that RI dues constitute a small percentage (generally less than 20%) of the outlay for the
    privilege of the Rotary pin. What is more, every penny of this contribution is accounted for. Can the same 
    claim sustain for the district dues, other fund raisers and the club funds. There is an urgent need to
    remedy the state of affairs at the club and District administration and introduce the buzz word-Transparency
    <BR>
    <BR>
    Sure, the COL has stipulated some guidelines but they do not seem adequate to me. Afterall our culture is 
    different to what is the norm in the west and the USA. <BR>
    <BR>
    It is time that we ourselves formulated a code of conduct. <BR>
