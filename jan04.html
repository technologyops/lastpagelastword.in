                    The festive season is nearing a close. Many of the Rotary District Conferences are either concluded or is about to happen.<br>
                    <br>
                    One subject that hopefully would have been meaningfully explored is The Rotary Foundation. The problem is the foundation seems to be like an elephant being examined by many blind men. Some think the elephant is just a tree or a big leaf or a brush. In the same manner many Rotarians view only one facet of The Rotary Foundation. Some say that this is collection agency, others feel that this here money can be had for all or any of their pet projects. Regrettably few understand the total cycle of The Rotary Foundation.<br>
                    <br>
                    Rotary in Great Britain &amp; England is an organization that I have always admired and the candid admission of the real state of affairs will do every Briton proud. I quote from &#8220;Allan Jagger, RIBI foundation chair writing June 2003 issue of &#8220;Rotary&#8221;. &#8220;Whatever total we donate / give this year it is worth remembering that we will remain nett recipients of Rotary foundation funds here in RIBI. I will explain by looking at the funding of humanitarian programmes first:&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    The figures of Matching Grants awards to Clubs in RIBI during 2001-02 were:&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    <table border="1" width="80%" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
                      <tr>
                        <td width="70%" valign="top" align="right">Matching Grants Awards &#8211; World Fund</td>
                        <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left">	$	1,084,375&nbsp;</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td width="70%" valign="top" align="right">Matching Grants &#8211; DDF contributions</td>
                        <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left">	$	350,414&nbsp;</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td width="70%" valign="top" align="right">Community Assistant Programmes &#8211;DDF</td>
                        <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left">	$	80,588</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td width="70%" valign="top" align="right">Total</td>
                        <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left">	$	1,515,377&nbsp;</td>
                      </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>Therefore, in Humanitarian Grants alone 68 percent of the annual giving from RIBI was returned to support our humanitarian projects! If we look further into what we in RIBI receive into our economy through the educational programmes of The Rotary Foundation it becomes clearer why the rest of the Rotary world cannot understand why, in their terms we give so little. RIBI hosts annually approximately 225 Ambassadorial Scholars with a maximum $25,000 scholarship. That is an income stream for our Universities in Great Britain and Ireland of $5,625,000, add 20 Rotary world peace Scholars at Bradford University on a similar grant of $ 500,000, total = $6,125,000. We can assume that each scholar we spend at least $1,500, so the grand total of income we enjoy in RIBI from TRF is well over $6 million. If we estimate there are 60,000 Rotarians in RIBI we receive cash into out economy of $100 per Rotarian, the very sum that we are encouraged to donate annually by 2005. That is why; if we are to fund our charity in real terms and not rely on the generosity of other Rotarians worldwide, we have to set our target much.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    I would guess that most Rotarians in RIBI still believe that it is wrong to &#8220;buy&#8221; a Paul Harris Fellow and they still think this after numerous articles and presentations explaining this misconception. PHF was never meant to be a Rotary service award but recognition of a donation to TRF of $1,000.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    The Rotary Foundation supports every Rotarian&#8217;s effort in the fulfillment of the Object of Rotary, a promise that we made when we became Rotarians. Fund Development is the provider of money, money means programmes, programmes means outcomes, outcomes mean people &#8211; the very people we promise to serve.&#8221;&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    So who is helping who !!&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Surely this illustrates how everyone benefits by The Rotary Foundation,<br>
