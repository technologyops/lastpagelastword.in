    <B> Not A Laughing Matter </B><BR><BR>
    As there is a shortage of clean jokes (!), I make it a point to find printable
    jokes from around the world, including cyber world. Today most of the Rotary 
    club bulletins have a jokes corner. Good jokes from these bulletins are reproduced
    in Rotary News. However the disturbing trend seen in some bulletins is that, 
    they publish jokes about one community or the other. A joke involving the Casanova
    James Bond published in the bulletin of a club from the city of palaces, may even
    offend the religious sentiments of a community. Though such jokes may evoke laughter
    or a smile, certainly this will not keep the Rotarians of the community at the
    receiving end in good humour. While strongly denouncing such trends, I wonder
    why the District Governors do not frown upon such bulletins. We have strongly
    objected to such jokes while reviewing the bulletins, which were entered for the 
    annual ‘best bulletin contest.’ If such jokes amongst people and especially amongst 
    Rotarians, lead to misunderstanding, surely this is not a laughing matter.<BR><BR>

    Attending Rotary International Conventions has been a habit of Rotarians from India. 
    TWA (Trans World Airlines) operated a convention flight No.905 from Bombay to Paris 
    in May 1953. <BR><HR><BR>
    
    
     <B>ELECTIONS AND ROTARY</B><BR><BR>
    
    Every month, I start off with a resolve not to write about elections (in Rotary). And 
    every month some item trips me up. This time it is the US Presidential elections and 
    the televised debate that put paid to my wish to abstinence!<BR><BR>

    How is it that Rotary with its roots in USA has adopted a set of rules and regulations for 
    electing Governors, that is observed more in breach? Canvassing is prohibited as per rules, 
    but is rampant to the extent of corruption in kind or money for setting up even the 
    nominating committee. An informal debate between the candidates for Rotary positions is 
    not the norm, but is the standard practice for the US Presidential contest.<BR><BR>

    It is time the Rotarians woke up and wrote in their suggestions for the next Council on 
    Legislation, before the rot sets in.<BR><BR>

    <B>You Said it</B><BR><BR>
   
    The urge to dash off a letter to the editor of a newspaper on any socially relevant topic, 
    or any disturbing event including complaints against public utility services, is understandable. 
    But if this trait lands one with an entry in the Guinness Book of Records, should it be
    commendable? Though I am not undermining the talent of writing or being honoured with a place 
    in the hallowed book, most writers of letters to the editors seem to be interested only in 
    seeing their names in print. In this case, a Rotarian couple, who have both entered the 
    Guiness Book for writing the maximum number of letters to the editors of newspapers and 
    magazines in a year, have desired that this achievement be publicised in this magazine. A 
    quick search revealed that not one letter was received by us on any topic, particularly when 
    we cater exclusively to Rotarians. This brings us to the point that letter writing must be 
    encouraged and habitual letter writers can try and graduate to writers of articles, which 
    will find more space in the press and can also benefit the readers. Incidentally, letters 
    can be either bouquets or brickbats and if they are truely analytical, editors would only 
    be too happy to publish them.<BR><BR>

    <B>EDITOR’S NIGHTMARE</B><BR><BR>

    Reports sent in by the enthusiastic Rotarians from clubs do tell us about the work being done 
    by the clubs in serving the community. But the composition of the reports leave a lot to be desired.
    <BR><BR>

    A report of a zonal seminar in a club bulletin caught my attention since the topic was literacy. 
    Hoping to pick up some clues for the impending Presidential Celebration in Literacy, I read the 
    report. Spread over two pages, the item was full of names of those who talked, welcomed, proposed
    thanks and questioned, but was deafeningly silent on what transpired, failing to mention even one 
    quote of a speaker! There is something wrong here. <BR>
