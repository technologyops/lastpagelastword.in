        Whenever I feel crestfallen about something or other in Rotary I seem to
        stumble upon the feelings of others. Our Hyderabad District
        Correspondent sent in this note - A doyen of Information Technology
        revolution in India had this to say about Rotary:<BR>
        Mr. Ramalinga Raju of Satyam Computers Ltd., says &quot;Rotary
        epitomized globalization long before it had b ecome a byword and
        fashionable. RI's approach to voluntary work and philanthropy by persons
        in business and vocation is the forerunner to the concept of 'Corporate
        Social Responsibility' on which so much emphasis is now laid. While a
        lot of importance is given to knowledge and technology, distributive
        justice and eradication of poverty will not happen unless the wealthy
        reach out with their time rather than money, and again in this, Rotary
        shows the way.&quot;<BR>

        <B>Elections Ahoy !</B><BR>
        <BR>
        Elections continue to excite my fellow Indians whether it be the general
        election for electing the parliamentarians, or election to a committee
        to nominate a Rotary governor. The role of the media is always suspect
        in these times even though the undersigned belongs to this fraternity.
        To illustrate the point, a news item was sent in by a well-intentioned
        Rotarian. The banner headlines read &quot;Rotary Governor election&quot;
        and goes on to name the Rotarian with the photograph as having been
        elected to the nominating committee for the Governor. Further the report
        goes on to state the number of votes polled by the candidate which one
        believes is not to be revealed. In future we look forward to reporting
        the list of candidates who have filed their candidature as candidates
        for the election to the nominating committee of the Rotary governors,
        and getting this reported in the media. <BR>
