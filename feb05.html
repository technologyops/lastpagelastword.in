               <B>One Size Does Not Fit All</B><BR>
		<BR>
		Hundred years of glorious service is a good time to take a close 
		look at our organisation and some of its rules. Any vibrant organisation,
		embarking into the next century of activity, more specifically service activity,
		must consider various factors which will take it smoothly through the next one
		hundred years.  This assumes importance since the biggest asset of Rotary is its
		members.<BR>
		<BR>
		Any organisation, not keeping in tune with the changing times, values and 
		aspirations of the individuals who form the backbone of it, will eventually run
		into problems, mostly human relations.  The recent happenings in Rotary in this
		part of the world indicates that the time has come for a closer scrutiny.   What
		rules or practices that are followed in one part of the world cannot be said to
		be true for the rest of the world.  In USA, there is no problem with politicians
		retiring from service, especially the President who has only eight years (if
		elected for the second term) to govern.  However, the Indian politician does not
		retire.<BR>
		<BR>
		Do we see a similarity in Rotary here?  Elections to the post of District 
		Governor in the districts in India have become bitter.  Many petitions have been
		filed in the courts of the land.  It is to be noted with concern that the courts
		are now taking a close look at the rules governing the election in Rotary.  Some
		of the legal luminaries in Rotary should probably put their heads together to
		reframe some provisions of the manual of procedure and ensure that bitter
		battles are fought within the organisation and not outside.<BR>
		<BR>
		One size does not fit all.  The rules governing the selection of governors
		in USA, for example, may not be relevant in India.  There may be difficulty in
		some countries finding a District Governor.  Not so in India!  What is most
		disturbing is the tendency to bend any nominating committee rules.  Probably
		every club can have a member voting thus making it difficult to set up or
		manipulate the committee.<BR>
		<BR>  
		The tendency to get away with any action has only made clubs project candidates
		with little or meager Rotary knowledge to contest for the post of Governor.  It
		is also necessary to dispense with the practice of having more votes for clubs
		with more members.  Probably the presidents may be asked to indicate their
		choice by a show of hands at an appropriate event.  Of course, no one should be
		afraid of indicating their choice! <BR>
		<BR>
		If true democracy and federal structure is required for efficient running of 
		any organisation, isn&#146;t it time we introduced it in Rotary too?<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>Reporting The Tsunami</B><BR>
		<BR>
		The antennae is up looking for stories of tsunami. How has it affected the
		community? Do Rotarians have a story to tell either of their own experience or
		what they have seen and heard? What has been the effort of Rotarians in relief
		and rehabilitation? The answers can only be dispiriting so far.<BR>
		<BR>
		Except for the report on the destruction wrought by the killer waves sent within
		10 days by Past District Governor V. Srinivasa Gobalan, RI District 2980, (which
		was the most severely affected area in India), others were found wanting.<BR>
                <BR>
		Of course, a few Rotary Clubs got in touch with Rotary News to offer help. 
		Many more must have been in touch with the Rotary clubs in the affected areas
		directly. A few NGO&#146;s too did contact us and we directed them to contact the
		District Governor.<BR>
		<BR>
		Rotarians responded to the need with emergency relief measures but the 
		organisation seemed slow to respond to relief. It is now hoped that Rotary will
		play an active role in rehabilitation and providing shelters and vocations. <BR>
                <BR>
		It is grossly undignified on the part of a section of the media, particularly
		some TV Channels to thrust a microphone in the mouth of the hapless victims. All
		sense of decency have been thrown to the winds. <BR>
		<BR>
		Photographs of Rotary club members standing in a row in front of a truck 
		may be good proof of the generosity but don&#146;t make for dramatic reporting of the
		catastrophe and the role of Rotary. Can we look for on- the-spot reports of the
		measures of rehabilitation featuring the affected and telling their stories?<BR>
                <BR>
		This is a call for all concerned to be out there where the waves had visited and 
		tell us what is being done! President Bush and Clinton came together to
		announce their concern and help for tsunami victims. Will our regional political
		leaders stand together? Let the Rotarians be the unifying force.<BR>
