        Consolidate is the “mantra” (the solution) for effective administration and greater profits. In Rotary parlance profits translate into service
        opportunities. It is heartening to note that two Districts in Japan, 2520 and 2810 realised the wisdom of uniting. Each District has nearly 1,700
        Rotarians in 45 clubs. The wise governors recognised that by getting together, the districts could cut expenses, deliver services more efficiently, and
        attract better candidates for governor. “We asked every club about it, because reaching consensus is the Japanese way,” the governors reported, and
        the great majority of clubs favoured the proposal. The districts will consolidate in July 2003.<BR>
        <BR>
        Looking into our own area, the writer cannot cite one case of a merger of clubs, leave alone districts. This is when many of the clubs have on roll a
        membership of less than 20 and an attendance of hardly six or seven at meetings. If the club applied for a charter today, they will fall foul of the
        required minimum of 20 for the charter to be granted. Yet these clubs would not brook the idea of joining up with another club, mostly it seems for
        reasons of protecting one’s turf.<BR>
        Will we ever learn that in numbers we have strength?<BR>

        <B>Arch Klumph Fellow?!</B><BR>
        <BR>
        The other day my Rotary Club President asked me to become an Arch Klumph Fellow so that I can be known as Rtn. PHF AKF PDG Krishnan V. Chari. It is
        another matter that Rotary convention discourages use of such titles.<BR>
        <BR>
        On enquiry I found that this practice of asking for a contribution of US $26.10 (the original corpus with which Arch Klumph started The Rotary
        Foundation) was rampant. I (for one) am all for putting out the begging bowl for a good cause any time. But what took me aback was the quid pro quo! For
        a Paul Harris Fellow you get a pin, a medal and a nice-looking certificate presented at a function with suitable ceremony, besides the joy of
        contributing to one of the finest foundations in the world. But if every member of the club and the district is going to contribute the US $26.10 for
        AKF, I am afraid we will have to resort to mass distribution of certificates and the regalia. À la mass marriages.<BR>
        <BR>
        On further enquiry I found that the certificate for AKF will be locally produced and this is not an official recognition of The Rotary Foundation.<BR>
        <BR>
        Rotary has strict regulations governing the usage of the word ‘Rotary’ and the logo. Are there similar rules for usage of the names of Paul Harris
        and/or Arch Klumph? If not, should there be one is a question that may well be mulled over by the top brass of Rotary International.<BR>
        <BR>
        Somehow, one feels, by all means garner support for The Rotary Foundation, but why drag names into it!<BR>

        <!--<IMG border="0" src="RITheme2003-2004Small.gif" align="left" hspace="5" width="85" height="100">-->When
        the theme for the Rotary year 2003 – 2004 was announced, I remembered a story that will reinforce this theme for all Rotarians. <BR>
        <BR>
        There was a wealthy man living in a village who was known for his miserliness. He had amassed great wealth but did not spend even a paise on charity. In
        fact, nobody in the village had seen his hand extended – since he feared that people might take advantage of him!<BR>
        <BR>
        One day, walking along a river bank, he slipped and fell into the river. It was in spate and he was in danger of being carried away by the strong
        currents. He desperately shouted for help.<BR>
        <BR>
        A good Samaritan who heard the miser’s cries rushed to the river bank and shouted to him, “Give me your hand!” The miser did not respond, and kept
        on crying out for help. Then the goodhearted man remembered that the miser did not know how to extend his hand to anyone for anything. The good
        Samaritan did not give up. He quickly called out, “Take my hand.” The miser was saved.<BR>
        <BR>
        No prizes for guessing who the good Samaritan was – a Rotarian. <BR>
        <BR>
        This would seem to be the essence of next year’s theme for all Rotarians – to offer a hand whenever and wherever help is needed. Here’s wishing
        every Rotarian a new beginning in lending a hand to all those who need our helping hand.<BR>
