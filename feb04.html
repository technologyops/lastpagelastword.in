        Attending a few Rotary District Conferences certain thoughts came into
        mind that I share with fellow Rotarians.<BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        District conferences with 8 + hours of Rotary or service thoughts is no
        longer the flavour of the year. Beside the opening session that seem to
        have an audience of 800 to 1000 + the other plenary sessions are a
        ritual with the invited speakers or Rotary matters addressing an
        audience of 80 to 100.<BR>
        <BR>
        The ladies predictably after the opening sessions are seen outside the
        venue enquiring about the best possible shopping areas or direction to
        some entertainment shop for the kids.<BR>
        <BR>
        You do not need a ticket to listen to Rotary discourses but you must
        possess one for the entertainment sessions that are packed like sardines
        in a tin.<BR>
        <BR>
        Very few conferences seem to follow the clock. The clocks do not seem to
        wait for the politicians who invariably ‘clock’ in late.<BR>
        <BR>
        The disappearance of issues in our midst (Rotary), which sets wide slots
        of time for celebrations with projection of personalities is evident
        throughout.<BR>
        <BR>
        The cultural shows seem to begin and end with Indian TV and films or the
        fashion shows that seem to be more a display of skin than silk.<BR>
        <BR>
        Time has come for us to decide whether Rotary District Conferences need
        to focus on Rotary issues at all. Seems to me that the time is for
        revelry, recharging of thirst and repetitive revile of “he is a jolly
        good fellow”.</P>

        <P><B>‘Work Builds, Charity Destroys” – Baba Amte</B><BR>
        <BR>
        <B>Rajiv Mehrotra</B>: You have been a living example of the philosophy
        ‘charity destroys, work builds’. From where did you conceive this
        idea and how did it germinate?<BR>
        <BR>
        <B>Baba Amte</B>: I saw people becoming welfare addicts and I wanted to
        help people to help themselves. I looked at society and was confronted
        with deformity. I saw people with contorted bodies, others who had no
        thumbs, no toes and no fingers. They were unable to even show where they
        were in pain. Blind boys who could not see the great mountains or even a
        small pinch of salt on their dinner plate surrounded me. Their eyes were
        never caressed by rays of light, not even once in their lives. I
        observed children who simply sat with blank looks on their faces and I
        realized that they were present in this world, but totally absent in
        this world. Look around the globe and see how many patients are walking
        all alone. In Anandwan, we decided to walk together! I conceived the
        slogan “Charity destroys, work builds”, and as you see here, this is
        a world within a world, without the world. The residents produce
        everything themselves here, with the exception of salt, sugar and
        kerosene.<BR>
        <BR>
        A mighty faith has worked miracles.<BR>

        <I>(Taken from The Mind of the Guru by eminent media personality Rajiv
        Mehrotra, published by Penguin Books India 2003. The book is
        acompilation of conversations Mr.Mehrotra had with leading personalities
        as part of a television series for Doordarshan.)</I></P>

        <P><B>Mergers &amp; Acquisitions</B><BR>
        <BR>
        Every good hearted Rotarian is no doubt anxious to invite the fellowmen
        and women in society into Rotary world. What better service then opening
        the window to service. Incidentally this will also help us to reach the
        goal of 1.5 million (15lakhs) membership in the centennial year.<BR>
        <BR>
        This will be a stupendous task and I have a suggestion.<BR>
        <BR>
        Why not consider MERGERS ?<BR>
        <BR>
        In the corporate world mergers and acquisitions are a good avenue of
        expansion. Why not in Rotary?<BR>
        <BR>
        Let us invite the members of Inner Wheel to merge their organization
        with Rotary. It would make a lot of sense.<BR>
        <BR>
        Most members of Inner wheel clubs are spouses of Rotarians. I believe
        this was once the primary condition of membership. Now that the portals
        of Rotary have been thrown wide open to women, and now that we have
        excellent presidents of Rotary clubs and distinguished Governors from
        this group, the reason for maintaining a separate identity does not
        arise. If necessary some sort of apology can be worked out for keeping
        them out of the fold of Rotary. If American Indian tribes demand an
        apology for a different cause and effect why should these ladies not ask
        for one?<BR>
        <BR>
        Secondly, there are various proposals of family of Rotary including ones
        on membership for a family or atleast that of a Rotarian and spouse.
        Suggestions have also been made at club level for a reduced membership
        charge for them.<BR>
        <BR>
        Thirdly, most Rotarian tends to bring their spouse to the Rotary
        District conferences and other Rotary functions. As members of Rotary
        movement their contribution can be more sufficient.<BR>
        <BR>
        Fourthly, is the possibility of a lot more glitter and good ambience at
        Rotary meetings.<BR>
        <BR>
        This can be a good beginning for the next century!</P>
