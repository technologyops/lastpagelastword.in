        </b><br>
        Recently, the Ambassador of USA in India           Mr Robert Blackwill was quoted in the press as saying that there are no special restrictions on granting of visas to Indians by USA. He went on to say that over two thirds of the applicants are granted visas, which he seemed to think was good going.<br>
        <br>
        But  the one  third who  have been rejected visa don’t agree and it appears that there are many Rotarians too who are in this company.<br>
        <br>
        Applying for a visa to USA and Europe now bring back memories of sitting for a competitive examination to IITs/Professional colleges. A form of Russian roulette! You can never predict the result, a sort of middle age examination that many of us subject ourselves to. Of course you curse the system and say never again, but like James Bond you eat your humble pie: “Never say never again” and queue up again and again.<br>
        <br>
        But where does Rotary come in?<br>
        <br>
        Rtn Pradip Kothari of RI District 3040 was selected as the leader of Group Study Exchange to RI District 7390, USA but was refused a visa. Possibly the official at the consulate thought that this businessmen at the age of 50 will leave behind his wife and two children and properties in India as a potential immigrant. As for any standing of Rotary, the official we are told dismissed it, by saying “Rotary has nothing to do with us.” Two others who had been selected as GSE team members were also refused visas. We also hear now that last year too the whole GSE team (GSE team members and the leader) from RI District 3040 were refused visas to land in the star spangled country.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        But Rotarians can take heart. It is not just some of us who have problems of visas. Recently a journalist from a leading economic daily was refused a visa to the USA and the fourth estate had to take up the matter at the higher levels to get the visa. Wonder how Wallstreet Journal or New York Times would react if the Indian Government paid USA back in the same coin!&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        This brings to focus the usefulness of GSE programme. While the 120 plus districts from USA send out as many as 600 GSE team members to promote international relationship, a country like India with a vast population barely send out 100 or so. If this is also dependant on the vagaries of the bureaucrats of alien countries, it is time to take a fresh look at this Group Study Exchange programme.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Can we now expect a constructive debate.<br>
        <br>
        This is the way to promote international understanding and the way to avoid international misunderstanding<br>
        <br>
        <b>Temples of Rotary</b><br>
        <br>
        Recently it so happened that I visited many temples. Not that I am overtly a zealot who carries his religion on his sleeve, but this was a good break from the routine.<br>
        <br>
        The cleanliness at Guruvayoor, Kerala warmed the cockles of the heart, only to be brought down by a thump at the squalor on some others. The aesthetic beauty of century old constructions was marred by the latter day additions of crude baricades and loosely hung electric wires, inviting the devotees to sacrifice themselves by electrocution! (Memory recalls the furore created in the Indian media when Prince Philip of UK, when walking around a factory in Britain observed a jumble of loosely connected wires in a electric junction box remarked: “This must be the work of an Indian”).<br>
        <br>
        Pandit Nehru’s allusion to the huge public sector enterprises as Temples of Modern India acquired a significant meaning during the visit. We are good at constructing beautiful structures - temples, townships, forts, et al - but are known to be poor at protecting / preserving them, and most of them are in a state of sheer neglect. What has happened to the Temples of Modern India is a similar story with most of them having fallen sick and now a burden on the populace!<br>
        <br>
        But where does Rotary come in?<br>
        <br>
        What was breathtaking was the faith displayed on the face of devotees at Samayapuram temple, near Trichy, in particular. An economist would probably describe the crowd as belonging to the working class, but their faith in the goddess was writ on their faces and the contributions poured out in a stunning fashion. I could not but feel: Do I see the same faith on the face of the Rotarians about Rotary? Do I see them opening their hearts and purses in the same fashion? On the second issue of new temples, are we in danger of forming new Rotary Clubs while neglecting the old ones? For an answer to this question, watch this space!<br>
        <br>
        <b>A Mid Year "Auld Lang Syne"<br>
        </b><br>
        Another Rotary year comes to an end.<br>
        <BR>But the spirit of theme “Mankind is Our Business” will live on and continue to be in our thoughts and actions forever. A year that will be remembered for the tremendous progress in increased membership in Rotary.
