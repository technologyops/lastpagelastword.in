        <P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size="3">I had often mentioned about the expenses in Rotary that could be looked at by the lay public as unnecessary. So
        I was quite happy that there are others in Rotary who also harbour similar sentiments. Here is an extract from a Rotary Club bulletin.<BR>
        <BR>
        “<B>In the Soup...</B><BR>
        <BR>
        One could be forgiven for wondering if the Rotary year begins in August, rather than July. It is only towards the end of July that many Rotary Clubs
        have put their annual show piece viz., their installations behind them, and begin to think of doing some service activity. With over 100 clubs in
        Calcutta and the suburbs, the DG also finds it a Herculean task to attend all the installation meetings and juggle his other duties at the same time. If
        you analyse each installation, the dignitaries on the dais speak almost the same words. The audience comprises the same set of people, with the host
        club members added on. The dinner buffets, the bar, the venues, even the topics of discussion tend to become all too familiar. And so an entire month
        (and more) wears out in this celebration of Rotary’s annual change of guard.<BR>
        <BR>
        The merits and demerits of installation meets have been debated upon each year with no conclusive result. However, the fact remains that an estimated Rs.
        35-40 lakh flows out from the clubs’ kitty on this exercise. Whether or not this is justified is a moot point. In my humble opinion, the clubs could
        easily reach a compromise in a number of ways. One way is to organise joint installation meetings with 2 or 3 clubs. The disadvantage here is the
        excessive length of the combined agenda of the clubs. Another way is to have simple meetings with tea and snacks. Yet another is to combine a service
        project inauguration with the installation. In most districts abroad, the concept of installation meetings is very different. The change of collar takes
        place at a regular meeting and that’s it!<BR>
        <BR>
        Club presidents are well aware of the limited usefulness of profligate installations, yet only a few are ready to bell the cat and cut down on the
        expenditures involved, quoting past precedent. However, the winds of change have blown the cobwebs off many of Rotary’s rules (including territorial
        limits, attendance, classification etc.) and Rotary is undergoing many a face lift in order to remain relevant in the future. In this dynamic scenario,
        there is a need to rethink on many related issues. Among them, surely, is the installation meeting.”<BR>

        Our thanks to the Editor of the club bulletin.<BR>

        (Roughly translated - The subjects will mirror<BR>
        the king in all respects)<BR>

        <BR>
        Is the saying that comes to mind when we look at some of the happenings in Rotary. The only difference is the citizens (the Rotarians) do not seem to
        emulate the leaders readily.<BR>
        <BR>
        At a recent meeting, R.I. President Bhichai Rattakul had to remind the knowledgeable Rotarians who were the speakers on some of the basic protocols.
        Many of us have sat through meetings where each speaker addressed all the dignitaries with suitable titles honorary or otherwise and took us to the
        edges of boredom.<BR>
        <BR>
        So it was a pleasant surprise when R.I. President Bhichai was called up to speak as the 4th speaker of the session. He said, quote, “I am dispensing
        with the salutations to all the distinguished persons here. This is not to lessen the importance of the other speakers but to spare the audience of
        repetition since the dignitaries have already been greeted thrice!”<BR>
        <BR>
        This practice may well be worth emulating. Let the first person who welcomes the gathering name all those assembled and the succeeding speakers can well
        get on to the chosen topic right away.<BR>
        <BR>
        I am told that R.I. President Bhichai is also not very supportive of elevated dias since he asserts that he too is a common Rotarian on the same footing
        as every other Rotarian. A young Rotarian was so impressed by these humble qualities that, he says “I will follow R.I. President Bhichai Rattakul to
        the ends of the world.”<BR>
        <BR>
        Thank you, Rtn R.I. President Bhichai, for leading the way.<BR>
        <BR>
        <B>Dine in style</B><BR>
        <BR>
        At Rotary meetings where dinner is served, it is usually “buffet” style. The man or woman holds a plate in one hand with heaps of food and eats with
        the other, balancing the plate like a juggler. All the while the mouth is doing the functions of both eating and chatting, and the legs do the walking
        and circulating among the assembled gentry.<BR>
        <BR>
        Now a sea-change has happened. Move over Buffet - Come in Banquets. Seated at tables with restricted number of persons to chat with and partaking
        whatever was served as food seems to be the in thing at Rotary seminars and workshops.<BR>
        <BR>
        I have no complaints. Considering my age now, I prefer to sit and eat. However where it hurts is in the purse with charges for such luxuries at Rs. 1000
        every time.</FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size="3"><BR>
