        WINNERS ALL<BR>
        Recently I read the book “Stop Whining and start winning” by Frank Pacetta. Authoring this column, I am understandably conscious that issues are to
        be highlighted for a healthy discussion and not a whine. Pacetta says “My mission is to emotionalise your business, your career and your life. There
        is too much complacency and mediocrity poisoning what could be exhilarating, rewarding and satisfying professional experiences”. (I would like to add
        Rotary to the list too - my addition). “The first requirement is a genuine passion for people. As a leader, the one overwhelming desire must be to see
        the people around one should succeed. Failure to recognise extra effort and success is a message that hard work is not all that important. Team building
        is a full time job and it is never done. Keeping confidence in the team is the crux of achievement. Breaking confidence means that you have finished
        team building - then the team is finished. Kaput.”<BR>
        <BR>
        There is a message out there for all the Rotary leaders.<BR>
        <BR>
        GUARD THYSELF<BR>
        In Chennai (i.e Madras for those North of the border of Tamil Nadu) we have had a spate of robberies in police personnel’s homes. Newspaper reports
        talk of many sovereigns of gold and cash that was stolen by thieves who obviously knew where the loot was. With most citizens groaning under the
        oppressive taxes in March, the thieves obviously knew who has money stashed away in the bedsteads!! A thought struck me. If such exorbitant amounts can
        be found in the policeman’s houses, why are we busy providing basic amenities for the police force which they should be able to afford!<BR>
        <BR>
        GIVE WITH ONE HAND………<BR>
        The polio eradication private sector campaign is hotting up. In India we need to raise another Rs 25 crores, so it is said. A flyer the undersigned
        received through mail says ” The best part is World Bank have pledged additional support for every donation we receive.”<BR>
        <BR>
        ………….TAKE AWAY WITH THE OTHER<BR>
        As I was mulling over this munificence, a news item caught my attention. The World Bank have set up a back office at Chennai. The financially
        beleaguered Tamil Nadu state government has provided sales tax exemption to World Bank on purchase of Rs 68 lakhs worth of material here, a sum of may
        be Rs 7 lakhs. Besides the fact that I feel the pinch of sales tax being a resident of Tamil Nadu, I am surprised that World bank is looking for
        subsidies in any form when they frown on subsidies while funding a project by Governments of third world countries.<BR>

        “HELLO ROTARY”<BR>
        <BR>
        A Nice thought on 19 April 2002.<BR>
        <BR>
        I got this in email<BR>
        <BR>
        “Hello, my friend in Rotary,<BR>
        <BR>
        It is a pleasure to say Hello to you, especially today. Paul Harris was born this day. It is when he felt, how sorely he missed someone say ‘Hello’
        to him, that he created Rotary !<BR>
        <BR>
        Say Hello to a member who has missed several meetings in your club,<BR>
        Say Hello to someone who likes Rotary, but is not in it,<BR>
        Say Hello to your President / Secretary who seem to be calling others all the time and no one seems to say hello to them,<BR>
        Say Hello to a member who has gone out of Rotary,<BR>
        <BR>
        Simply say “Hello” As a friend put it,<BR>
        <BR>
        The word “HELLO” means:<BR>
        H = How are you?<BR>
        E = Every thing all right?<BR>
        L = Like to hear from you<BR>
        L = Love to see you soon!<BR>
        O = Obviously, I care for you...<BR>
        <BR>
        So, HELLO! And Have a Nice Day !!<BR>
