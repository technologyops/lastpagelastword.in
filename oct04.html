         <B>ROTARY REDISCOVERED</B><BR>
         <BR>
         Dragging the family into the prayer room, the child commanded, “Say after me, Oh god, please 
         help all of us. Please  help all the people who drowned  in the flood.” I could not but laugh till I 
         realized what  he was saying. In the morning, looking out of the window, the two  of us witnessed 
          a big puddle  of water in front of the house which  the child looked at  and said, “Why do we have 
         a  flood in front of our house. Can  we get out? Will anybody be drowned  in the water?” Obviously, 
         he was concerned  that other people may drown. That is when I rediscovered  the essence of 
         Rotary from my 5 year old grandson: Rotary is “caring for people.”<BR>
         <BR>
         <B>SPIRITUALLY ROTARY</B> <BR>
         <BR>
         Recently a Rotary club situated in a sun-and-waves-kissed port city inducted  a member with the 
         Rotary classification of ‘Spiritual Consultant.’ Needless to say that, I have come across many 
         spirited consultants, but this is the first time such a classification has come to  my notice in our part 
         of the world. Hopefully, the new member would instill noble qualities into the members of the club. 
         Will the Rotarian be addressed as Rotarian Swamiji so and so, or the other way?<BR>
         <BR>
         <B>PRINT IT</B><BR>
         <BR>
         It is fashionable nowadays to say that we do all our communications via e-mail.
         I, for one, am still nostalgic about the “Heidelberg” machine - waiting to see most of the 
         communications addressed to me in print rather than plucking it in from ether space (or some 
         computer in some faraway place).<BR>
         <BR>
         E-mail has its uses for short, pointed interaction among business and professional persons and 
         Rotarians. The usefulness of e-mail diminishes in proportion to the number of persons an e-mail is 
         addressed to!  There is a strong urge to delete the message in my inbox when I see the message 
         addressed to umpteen persons including me.<BR>
         <BR>
         I can carry the written word with me on a train, bus, car or even a plane, and (that is the crux)
         I don’t need to balance the apparatus on my lap.<BR>
         <BR>
         It will be a long long time before the “web” traps us all.<BR>
         Till then, happy reading “Rotary News” in print !!<BR>

         <B>THE ROTARY FOUNDATION</B><BR>
         <BR>
         The Rotary Foundation (TRF) activities continue to be in the thoughts of  Rotarians in India, more 
         precisely of the problems there in.<BR>
         <BR>
         
         A visiting Rotarian  narrated the story of how a local dignitary was presented the Paul Harris Fellow 
         medallion without anyone making a contribution to The Rotary Foundation.  What is more, the 
         dignitary uses  “PHF” as a prefix to his name too! Is there a mechanism  to pull up the clubs 
         resorting to such unsavoury  practices?<BR>
         <BR>
         Another Past President met me to seek advise on how to handle  complaints from a couple of 
         Rotarians who had made contributions to TRF in anticipation of a matching contribution from the RI 
         District which did not materialize.  Such are the problems of accountability.<BR>
         <BR>
         I happened to come across views in a Rotary bulletin that presents a view point of the problem.  I 
         quote (excerpts) from that bulletin....  <BR>
         <BR>
         “It is an insult to Indian Rotary clubs when the news is that no club is currently eligible to receive 
         any funding from The Rotary Foundation.  The reason?  No Rotary club has submitted the required 
         reports.  No Rotary project is complete without the final report.  We seem to be only interested in 
         getting a matching grant.  Once the grant is received and the project completed, we forget 
         everything.  This is because of the manner in which the matching grant is obtained.  The club, as a 
         whole, has no interaction with the matching club abroad.  When the project is over, the receiving 
         club does not know the name of the matching club and they don’t write a thanking letter to the 
         matching club which has donated money.  This is because these grants are “arranged” by some 
         Past District Governors/Rotarians interested in the District Governor election, and clubs receive 
         these grants as a gift for services rendered.  Hence the clubs show no commitment in reporting.  
         They don’t  know what they have to report and to whom to report.  To avoid such things, clubs 
         must be encouraged to work directly with the donor matching club abroad and TRF.<BR>
         <BR>
         
         The senior District Leaders should offer only guidance to clubs as to how to work on such grants.  
         When the clubs develop direct relationship with the matching donor club,  reporting would follow.  
         For the present situation of matching grants in India, our leaders are partly responsible.  If  trained 
         well on matching grants, clubs in India would do a perfect job  because, in India, Rotary is serious 
         business.”  <BR>
         <BR>
         <B>Much thought for the festive season.</B><BR>
