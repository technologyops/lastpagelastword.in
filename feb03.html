        <B>Overcrowded Stage</B><BR>
        <BR>
        The editor of “The Quilon Rotarian,” Zachariah K. Samuel, makes an interesting observation in the bulletin that seems appropriate in the conference
        season.<BR>
        <BR>
        “Whenever we organise a function, it is common sight that the stage is overcrowded with so many persons. Everybody considers it a prestige issue that
        he or she is provided a seat on the stage. To maintain the desired decorum of the meeting only a person who has a direct role in the function should be
        accommodated on the stage. Just compare the prize distribution ceremony of a cricket match in India and one held in some other country. In India, a
        minimum of 15-20 persons would occupy the stage whereas in similar functions held elsewhere the number will be 3 or 4. The whole charm of the function
        is spoiled by these overcrowded stages.<BR>
        <BR>
        As a GSE team leader I attended a District Conference of 6050 in USA and at the inaugural function of the conference only three persons were on the
        stage - the conference chairman, the person who was to inaugurate the conference and the Rotarian who was to introduce the chief guest. The District
        Governor was seated in the front row. Only at the Governor’s Banquet did he occupy the stage along with his wife. Compare this to a Rotary function in
        this part of the country. It is a point of heated discussion who all will be seated on the stage when we organise a Rotary meeting. When a District
        Governor is attending a meeting, what is the relevance of the Asst. District Governor or a GGR occupying the stage? We have to accept the fact that a
        seat in the front rows is an honour equivalent to a seat on the stage. But, who will bell the cat?”<BR>
        <BR>
        Food for thought indeed!<BR>
        <BR>
        <B>Good news for Rotary clubs</B><BR>
        <BR>
        I generally frown upon using these columns to promote individuals or their businesses but when an offer is made that might benefit Rotary clubs
        financially to serve, who am I to stand in between?<BR>
        <BR>
        “A fundraising opportunity is ahead of you.<BR>
        <BR>
        You must be aware that Reliance Infocom has launched mobile telephone services in over 600 cities in India. It is very natural that Rotarians, their
        families and friends will also subscribe for these services in good number. We have worked out a scheme through which your club will get Rs. 100/- per
        subscription made by Rotarians or their friends through your club. If you are interested in joining this scheme, you may immediately contact by phone or
        through e-mail to know the modalities. Specially coded application forms with the word ‘ROTARY’ are available and will be sent on demand. Hurry up!
        If you are able to get hold of even 100 subscribers through your efforts, your club will get a minimum of Rs. 10,000/- to support a good cause.<BR>

        <BR>
        Of course, I must add that I have not had the privilege or the experience of relying on Reliance yet and “caveat emptor” I say.<BR>

        <B>COUNTRY HAS FUNDS FOR A-BOMB<BR>
        but NOT FOR HOUSES FOR POOR</B><BR>
        <BR>
        I recently read a newspaper cutting that had the above banner headline. It was a remark made by a Rotarian from an European nation when handing over 16
        low cost shelters in India built with the assistance of his club.<BR>
        <BR>
        I, for one, feel sad because such remarks do not help in promoting international understanding or the Rotary cause in any way. A wag might say, “Ok,
        let us not build a bomb.” Then the question comes down to all kinds of armament, not just nuclear bombs.<BR>
        Further the Rotarian said that his club raised these questions before the funds were released for the project: “Why do people not construct their own
        houses? Will the funds be utilised for constructing houses or for some other purpose?” Sitting in the welfare state of Europe, people can make
        statements.<BR>
        <BR>
        Surely there is an element called dignity even if one is poor, or should we merely accept such remarks?!<BR>

        <P><B>Receipts against contributions to Rotary Foundation India<BR>
        </B><BR>
        “Rotary Foundation (India) has been receiving contributions from Rotary Clubs and Rotarians all over India and issuing receipts in the names of more
        than one individual against a single cheque/demand draft as per the instructions received. The auditors of Rotary Foundation (India) have raised an
        objection to this practice and have pointed out that as per Indian laws and regulations it is mandatory to issue one receipt against one cheque/demand
        draft received and the same is to be issued to the Donor only.<BR>
        <BR>
        In the meeting of the Executive Members of RF (I) it has been decided that with immediate effect RF(I) would issue only receipt against a single cheque/demand
        draft. However, the recognition may be given to more than one individual. In view of the above, it is requested that the contribution form/letter should
        accompany each contribution giving the details of the person like ID No., Name of the Rotary Club etc., in whose name the receipt is to be issued.”<BR>
