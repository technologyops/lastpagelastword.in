                <B>Reaching for the stars</B><BR><BR>    
                This is the time of the year of PETS in
Rotary. Do not blame me, if you conjure up other images. I
am referring to the training of the incoming Rotary Club
leaders. Attending some of these is an interesting
experience. Some focus on motivation (preaching to the
converted?!) while some others seem to take on too much in
terms of the scope of work in the year ahead. <BR><BR>
		In general,the sincere commitment of the incoming leaders
is infectious and every one is raring to go like the horses
in the starting stalls at the races. What is the rub? Are
we loading them with diverse tasks rather than focusing on the
key  aspects of the theme and goals for the year ahead? 
		<BR><BR>
		However, what is of paramount importance is the fact that
the incoming president should be aware of the ongoing
projects that the clubs are undertaking. The president
should pick up the ropes and continue the projects with
diligence. <BR><BR>
		Here is hoping that the leaders will digest through all
the talks and discussions and make their plans and goal for
the Rotary year - the first year of the second
century.<BR><BR>
		<B>Establish Credibility</B><BR><BR>
		It is high time that Rotary districts have their norms
and conventions laid down that can be adhered to without
any hassle or disputes. The Board of Directors of RI have
approved the districts seeking the Board&#146;s approval for
their &#147;incorporation&#148; and registration. By this, all clubs
in the district would be members of the incorporated
district. And, the corporate documents of the district will
be consistent with RI&#146;s constitution, bylaws and policies.
Indeed a blessing in disguise, with the present uncertain
rules and flouted conventions not paving way for  either
credibility or accountability.<BR><BR>
		<B>Where is news?</B><BR><BR>
		Reading the Governor&#146;s Monthly Letters has been an
enlightening experience, filling one with pride of being a
Rotarian in the Centennial year. For example, DG
S.R.Yogananda of RI District 3190 has documented the
district&#146;s centennial projects carried out in a striking
manner.  But, alas, Rotary News has not been in the loop at
all, with the result many Rotarians are unaware of the
great work done by Rotary in India in general. This is the
reason why we have district correspondents in every
district. May be, they need to be more active. Or, Rotary
News has not motivated them adequately! <BR><BR>
		<B>Peace in our lifetime</B><BR><BR>
		Rotary World Peace Fellowship is a Rotary Foundation
Programme in which every Rotary District can participate.
No contribution or allocation is expected from the District
to propose a qualified candidate for the year 2006-08. I
believe the reason for non-participation could be either
lack of awareness or the will to pursue the task. Either
way it is not too late. Clubs and Districts should work
together in identifying suitable candidates and submit the
application to Evanston by July 1, 2005.<BR><BR>
		While on the subject, do Rotarians appreciate that the
core competence of Rotary is advocacy of peace, and the 
funding of the peace scholarships is from the Rotary
Foundation funds which in turn represents the generosity of
the Rotary family? It is critical to achieve the funding by
donations from individual Rotarians or friends of
Rotary.The other option is donation from the district
designated fund, an option that the Rotary districts can
easily avail!<BR></P>

		<B>Doing Rather Than Talking</B><BR><BR>
		The image of Rotary is created not by what we profess but
by what we practice; not by what we dream, but by what we
do in our clubs, in our business and professions.&#148; <BR><BR>
