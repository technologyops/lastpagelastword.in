<SPAN class="subhead">At the stroke of midnight &#133;</SPAN>
		<BR><BR>
		At the stroke of midnight of 30th June over 30,000 changes plus one take place in Rotary. The over 30,000 Rotary clubs pass on the baton to a new President and the one refers to the new RI President himself. Rotary International does not want to verify whether any installation with all pomp and ceremony has been completed. Any action commencing on 1st July is automatically addressed to the new Rotary club President.<BR><BR>
		
		This being the case, why are clubs persisting with the culture of an installation ceremony &#150; many a time with a lot of attendant costs about which one reader has written extensively &#150; is something beyond this writer&#146;s comprehension.
The installations go on in many districts right until the end of July, because the Rotary District Governor&#146;s dates are booked chock-O-block.<BR><BR>

		That brings on the question as to whether the District Governor, whose burden seems to have gone up dramatically over the years (like a school-goer carrying an increase of load of books et all) needs to be present at each and 
every installation of the club President. One was under the impression that the Assistant Governors are to take on some of these duties. However, what seems to happen is that the Assistant Governors also seem to congregate at the same venue as the District Governor, much as the ministers lining up at every departure and arrival of the Prime Minister of the country.<BR><BR>

		Can we adopt a convention that all installations of the leaders for the year be completed in the first week of July to enable the Rotarians to get on with our theme &#145;Service Above Self&#146;.<BR><BR>
		
		There is one more suggestion. If the District Governor wishes to honour the President by being present at the installation, why not a Gala Mega installation of the leaders in one ceremony. I am sure, a lot of time and money could be conserved. (Incidentally this is not a original suggestion. At least one Governor in South India has already shown the way).<BR><BR>
		
		<SPAN class="subhead">DO WE CARE ENOUGH ?</SPAN><BR><BR>

		President Carl Stenhammer has emphasised Rotary Youth Exchange as one of the focus areas of this Rotary year. Can we do better than to examine how the Rotarians of Indian subcontinent have fared on this account? <BR><BR>
		
		The writer distinctly remembers the various youth exchanges, both internationally and within India, that was a vibrant activity in many Rotary districts. Alas, in recent times nothing much is heard about this new generations programme. Or it could be that not enough publicity is visited upon these exchanges.<BR><BR>

		A problem that was encountered was the difference in the education system in India and USA / Europe resulting in the loss of one year in education of many participants. A Rotary colleague encouraged his 15 year old son to go on an exchange to USA some years ago. The young man returned a year later not only with an American drawl in his speech but full of self confidence . <BR><BR>
		
		The Rotarians in that community did not just take care of him but also cured the lad of a speech impediment he had before he left the shores of India. A gap of one year has not made any difference to this youth in his later life. Maybe the Rotarians need to approach the programme with boldness. <BR><BR>
		
		Some have pointed out that this programme mostly benefits the offsprings of Rotarians themselves. There is no discredit to the programme on this account. While we are at it, why not consider sponsoring a brilliant and talented youngster whose only disadvantage is lack of financial resources? The undersigned will be very happy to report in these columns such acts of Service above Self.
RYE is designed to be an international programme. On the other hand in a country like India the benefits of intra country (within India) can be enormous since the differences in culture in various states are significant, starting from language to food and clothing. We do need to build a better understanding amongst the Indians too. There were many a few years ago, but the concept seems to be in a state of repair now. <BR><BR>

		The time to begin renewed efforts may well be the New Generations Month - September. Will the Rotarians respond to the clarion call of youth and initiate activities and send us an avalanche of reports?
