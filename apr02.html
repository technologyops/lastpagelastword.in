        <BR>
        Kerala, god’s own country, is now strikers own country too. The Government schools are faced with the strike of teachers, and the students preparing
        for the SSLC examination are faced with problems, with no model examinations or help.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size="3">But the students of Alappuzha Government Model Girls High School, who are mostly from financially poor
        families, have a saviour in the form of the headmistress of the school. The SSLC students were asked to attend the revision classes at the residence of
        the headmistress, and many teachers who were on strike turned up at her house to teach the students. What is more, they also took the model examination
        in the house.<BR>
        <BR>
        We are proud of the headmistress D Vijayalakshmi who is a Rotarian of the Rotary Club of Alleppey, R I District 3210. A genuine case that should be
        recognised as “Service above self”.<BR>

        WORDS TO GROW BY<BR>
        <BR>
        “If you are passionate about Rotary and proud to be a Rotarian, surely the natural thing to do is to share all that is good about this wonderful
        organisation of ours with friends and business associates”.<BR>
        <BR>

        PRODUCTIVE WORK<BR>
        <BR>
        One of the recipients of this year’s Magasaysay award was Aruna Roy for community leadership and rights activism. Her forte is a struggle not for just
        transparency in the government but also demanding a share in governance itself for the ordinary people - The right to information. She expresses dismay
        that most Governments had limited the scope of the law to include only Government organisations and left out others. Ideally any organisation dealing
        with public funds, be it a union or voluntary body, should be accountable to the public.<BR>
        <BR>
        Many of Rotary’s operations at club or district or national or international level can also do with transparency and accountability in all spheres,
        and not only in financial matters. The patronage should not be based on the old boy network, but on the individual’s productive work for Rotary!<BR>
        <BR>
        THE MISSING FACES<BR>
        <BR>
        In between appointments, I happened to thumb through a five-year-old members directory (1996-97) of our Rotary District. Going to the section of my home
        club, I saw many photographs of people that I had almost forgotten. Yet these were the people who were members of my Rotary club. Some interesting
        statistics emerged. <BR>
        <BR>
        There were 71 members in 1996-97.<BR>
        3 had passed away since then.<BR>
        27 members had left Rotary between then &amp; now.<BR>
        41 members still give me the pleasure of their fellowship<BR>
        A full one third (33%) of my fellow men had left the Rotary fold in the last five years. (Mind you we are now 63 strong).<BR>
        <BR>
        A sad tale indeed, particularly when I, like many, thought it is only the western world that is losing the members in Rotary.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size="3">In some clubs we have a coterie of gods. They won’t allow any new members inside into the pantheon and do
        their utmost to protect the turf that they have occupied.<BR>
        <BR>
        I will close this by asking every Rotarian reader to do a similar study of his club. Do you get me?!<BR>
        <BR>
        TAKE IT - HERE IS AN AWARD<BR>
        <BR>
        Recently the undersigned was asked to speak to the District officers on the subject of Vocational Service. After the usual speech on the possible
        (occasional service, oops !) vocational service, I had the occasion to share my views on awards. The first being the rush to confer “For the Sake of
        Honour Awards” by all the clubs in the city. In Chennai alone over 50 clubs will have to scramble to find 50 persons deserving the honour. The
        undersigned can recall atleast three such awardees whose dealing in business came under a cloud for various offences in the courts. To top it all, now
        RI has made it an achievement to confer the vocational excellence award on one of our own ( in the club ) for qualifying for Presidential Citation. The
        scramble continues. We have even had instances of school teachers being given Vocational Excellence awards, the primary qualification being that they
        were the class teachers of the progenies of the award givers. Of course the point is that the lay public do not appreciate our bestowing honour on one
        of our ilk.<BR>
        Just not part of the local culture, what!<BR>
