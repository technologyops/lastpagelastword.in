        <B>War is a messy business.</B><BR>
        <BR>
        In the end nobody wins a war. Everyone is a loser. The Iraq war that has just concluded, or at least one phase of it, is no different. A newspaper in
        the United Kingdom has published details of the war in the form of a balance sheet (as on 10 May 2003) which summarises the war very succinctly.<BR>
        <BR>
        49&nbsp;Days since launch of the war<BR>
        2,500&nbsp;Iraqi civilians believed dead<BR>
        10,000 Iraqi combatants believed killed<BR>
        105&nbsp;US soldiers killed<BR>
        32&nbsp;British troops killed<BR>
        10&nbsp;Journalists killed, 2 missing<BR>
        30,000&nbsp;Bombing sorties by Allies<BR>
        50&nbsp;Cluster bombs dropped<BR>
        17,000,000 Iraqis reliant on food aid<BR>
        1&nbsp;in&nbsp;4 Iraqi children under 5 suffering from severe malnutrition<BR>
        40,000 Baghdad residents reliant on Red Cross for water<BR>
        40 Top ranking Iraqi leaders still at large including Saddam<BR>
        400&nbsp;Queries a day made to the Red Cross&nbsp;by Iraqis seeking loved ones<BR>
        $55 Billion spent on the war by the US<BR>
        $100&nbsp;Billion&nbsp;– the estimated cost of rebuilding Iraq<BR>
        55% - Bush’s approval rating before the war<BR>
        72%&nbsp;- After the war<BR>
        45%&nbsp;- Blair’s approval rating before the war<BR>
        52%&nbsp;- After the war<BR>
        0&nbsp;Weapons of mass destruction found.<BR>
        <BR>
        An authoritarian ruler has been driven out but the suffering&nbsp;of the Iraqis continues. Blockades and sanctions, it is now apparent, do not hurt the
        high and the mighty, but hits the men and women&nbsp;who are now literally on the streets.<BR>
        <BR>
        Rotarians should now be somewhere out there providing the desperately needed relief. Rotary leadership did indicate that our role would come after the
        politics (!) of war. Are we out there now? This is the need of the hour.<BR>
        <BR>
        For the naysayers who feel that this is politics and we should stay clear, I recall the beginning of a great agency called OXFAM. “In 1942, an Allied
        naval blockade aimed at the end of Nazi occupation of Greece was in place. But it also cut off the food supply to the civilians. 2,000 people were dying
        everyday in Athens and Piraeus. In Oxford, England, a small group of people began to raise money for helping those affected by the Greek famine.” (Of
        course 60 years since that day OXFAM is still getting through to many war-torn countries).<BR>
        <BR>
        The Thief of Baghdad maybe just a nostalgic fairytale but it has many varied shades today.<BR>
        <BR>
        Talking about humanitarian causes, I do not seem to have come across any reports of the work done by Rotarians in offering succour to the Kashmiri
        brethren who are in the midst of a different type of conflict. I do hope that I am wrong.<BR>
        <BR>
        (The lady who proofread this commented: “What can anyone do? You are not suggesting methods of meeting this need.” I replied: “My Rotary friends
        can find the way. They only have now to set their mind to it.”)<BR>
        <BR>
        <B>39 steps back in time</B><BR>
        <BR>
        39 Steps was a successful thriller of the good old days directed by Alfred Hitchcock. And going back in time - 39 years to be exact - was in itself a
        thrill. I was back in the Lake District of England after a gap of 39 years. This is without doubt one of the most beautiful and scenic places on this
        earth. While in 1964 the scenery and the environs were raw, now with the passage of time the place has acquired a mature beauty without the degradation
        one would expect in these modern times.<BR>
        <BR>
        A couple of things made a deep impression.<BR>
        <BR>
        Lake District is William Wordsworth’s country. What is admirable is that this great poet and his sister felt that universal education was the path to
        poverty eradication, and gave away many of their properties to primary schools for the poor. This was over a 100 years ago!<BR>
        <BR>
        The second impression relates to environment. Beatrix Potter is a well-known writer of children’s stories and the creator of Peter Rabbit and other
        characters. She lived in Victorian England where girls from wealthy families were not sent to regular schools but were groomed and taught by governesses
        at home. So this lady who did not attend a formal school wrote many stories that even today catch the imaginations of tiny tots around the world.<BR>
        <BR>
        The wealth that Beatrix amassed in writing was put to use in acquiring properties in the Lake District and protecting the environment. At the end of her
        life she gave away all her properties - vast tracts of land and forests in the rural areas - to the people of England and these now form a part of the
        National Trust of England.<BR>
        <BR>
        <B>What is the message for us?</B><BR>
        <BR>
        Just that people are the key to the development of humans and of nature, not some unknown faces in the government. These are shining examples for the
        Rotarians of South Asia.<BR>
