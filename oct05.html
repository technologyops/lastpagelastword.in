		On September 11, 2001, four years ago nineteen men turned four commercial  airplanes with passengers  into weapons of terror, attacking cities in the USA killing more than 3000 people. The consequences have led the world to a dangerous deterioration of peace. 
		<BR><BR>
		
		There was another September 11 in 1906. Gandhiji called a mass meeting of some 3000 Transvaal Indians to find a way to resist the South African Registration Act that required  Indians, Arabs and Turks  to register with the Government. <BR><BR>
		
		Writing later  in his book &#147;Satyagraha in Africa&#148;, Gandhi says &#147;Among  the 300 people in the meeting was Sheth Haji Habib, an old Muslim resident of South Africa. He stood up and declared in the name of the god that he would submit to that law and advised all present to do likewise.&#148;<BR><BR>
		
		What was significant was his decisions to act in defence of an unjust law and willingness to suffer the consequences<BR><BR>
		
		On that day September 11, 1906, in South Africa, the Indian non-violent movement was born, which went on to free 300 million people from the power of the British Empire and gave the 20th Century a most remarkable demonstration of the power of  non violent  struggle.<BR><BR>
		
		What will be remembered?<BR><BR>
		
		September 11, 1906, - Non Violence 95 years later,<BR><BR>
		
		September 11, 2001 - Violent Terror It is for Rotarians to contemplate! <BR><BR>
		
		Remember our quest for peace in our times. <BR><BR>
		
		A dream of our founder Paul Harris.<BR><BR>
		
		<SPAN class="subhead">A TRIPLE FILTER TEST</SPAN><BR><BR>

		A tale that makes a good reading In ancient Greece, Socrates was reputed to hold knowledge in high esteem. One day an acquaintance met the great philosopher and said, &#147;Do you know what I just heard about your friend?&#148; &#147;Hold on a minute,&#148; Socrates replied. <BR><BR>
		
		&#147;Before telling me anything I&#146;d like you to pass a little test. It&#146;s called the Triple Filter Test.&#148; <BR><BR>
		
		&#147;Triple filter?&#148; &#147;That&#146;s right,&#148; Socrates continued. &#147;Before you talk to me about my friend, it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what you&#146;regoing to say. That&#146;s why I call it the triple filter test. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true? &#148;Â (Sathyam?) &#147;No,&#148; the man said, &#147;actually I just heard about it and...&#148; <BR><BR>
		
		&#147;All right,&#148; said Socrates. &#147;So you don&#146;t really know if it&#146;s true or not. Now let&#146;s try the second filter, the filter of goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good?&#148; (Priyam?) &#147;No, on the contrary...&#148; &#147;So,&#148; Socrates continued, &#147;you want to tell me something bad about him, but you&#146;re not certain it&#146;s true. You may still pass the test though, because there&#146;s one filter left: the filter of usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me?&#148; (Hitham?) <BR><BR>
		
		&#147;No, not really.&#148; &#147;Well,&#148; concluded Socrates, &#147;if what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful, why tell it to me at all?&#148;<BR><BR>
		
		<SPAN class="subhead">LAST PAGE LAST TIME</SPAN><BR><BR>

		Every affair has an occasional break. Rotary has become a demanding activity since all of us have become increasingly aware of the service opportunities.<BR><BR>
		
		No wonder that I have also now become a victim to the pressures with increasing Rotary commitments and own business needs.<BR><BR>
		
		With some remorse, I have taken the hard decision to stop this column from this month.<BR><BR>
		
		I have enjoyed writing this column (82 times in the last seven years) and it appears to have reached out to many Rotarians who have spoken or written to me. I may have also tread on the toes of a few, but I  hasten to assure  that this is totally inadvertent and without malice.<BR><BR>
		
		Will I do this column again. Who knows?<BR><BR>
		
		As a James Bond movie title says, &#147;Never Say Never Again!&#148;<BR><BR>
