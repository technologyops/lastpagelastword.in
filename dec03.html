                    Eighteen months ago we crossed the half-century mark,
                    hitting our way, a la Sachin, towards the next milestone.<BR>
                    <BR>
                    It has thus far been a satisfying innings. We are full of
                    hopes and aspirations. With the usual unstinted co-operation
                    from all Rotarians, another landmark is within our reach.
                    The memories will certainly be cherished.<BR>
                    <BR>
                    It is time to reflect, to retrace through the sands of time,
                    on the highlights of the Rotary News since its 50thbirthday
                    on July 15, 2002. The reflection and passage over a period
                    of time mirrors the Rotarian-centric character of Rotary
                    News.<BR>
                    <BR>
                    There has been a soft and consistent approach towards making
                    “Rotary News” the preferred magazine of the Indian
                    subcontinent.<BR>
                    <BR>
                    There has been a complete change in the heart of the matter,
                    in the contents of Rotary News. In keeping with the progress
                    of time, Rotary News has access to up-to-date technologies.
                    Its quality too is comparable with other established news
                    magazines. Rotary News Trust is a self-sufficient outfit
                    now. Its in-house capabilities enables it to play an active
                    part in communicating the ethos of Rotary, not only to the
                    Rotarians but also to the general public. <BR>
                    <BR>
                    Many innovative features have been added to the contents of
                    Rotary News. Rotarians have contributed to the cause of
                    spreading Rotary information through quiz and crossword
                    puzzles, special features such as “Women in Rotary,”
                    “Membership Development,” “Rebuilding Gujarat.” The
                    coup de grace included a “Bulletin Contest”,
                    “Readership Survey” which is now unveiled to gauge the
                    Rotarian’s views on the quality and contents of Rotary
                    News. <BR>
                    <BR>
                    To come to the contributions from Rotary clubs for
                    publication in Rotary News, emphasis should be on hands-on
                    projects touching the lives of the community, with
                    appropriate write-ups. Submission of monthly reports, which
                    often happens, should be totally avoided. The photographs
                    should depict the actual happening. Snaps showing a row of
                    Rotarians posing for the picture do not attract other
                    readers.<BR>
                    <BR>
                    On its journey the editors may have willy-nilly trudged on a
                    few toes, which was never intentional, but was to drive home
                    some objective views. To put it mildly, the journey has just
                    begun. Promises fulfilled, Rotary News will carve a niche
                    for itself . With the support and cooperation of Rotarians,
                    Rotary News is sure to occupy its own elitist place in the
                    Rotary history of the Indian subcontinent.<BR>

                    Rotary - the magazine of RI in Great Britain and Ireland
                    carries many pages of classified advertisements. Recently
                    spate of advertisements from companies providing speakers
                    have appeared. It reads “A company specialising in
                    providing 1st class public speakers across the full spectra
                    of events. Whatever your budget, we will identify the right
                    speaker. Contact: ian@look-whos-talking.co.uk”. As speaker
                    banks have been tried without much success in Rotary here,
                    will some budding entrepreneur consider this as a new
                    vocation?rs.<BR>

                    <SPAN class="subhead">The Dabbawallah</SPAN><BR>
                    <BR>
                    The famous dabbawallahas of Mumbai have time and again
                    amazed everyone with their dexterity in switching lakhs of
                    tiffin boxes and regrouping them again. No wonder the
                    British monarchy thought fit to have a close encounter with
                    them recently. Their method of operation has baffled the top
                    academic brains in the country. A different kind of
                    ‘dabba’ has recently made news in one district. However
                    frivolous, the allegations of the ballot box (dabba?) being
                    switched has brought into sharp focus the need to conduct
                    elections in Rotary in the most transparent manner. Surely,
                    when the RI Director has chosen to write about elections in
                    Rotary should we not sit up and take note?<BR>

                    <SPAN class="subhead">All in the Family<BR>
                    </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
                    In the last couple of months some of the top brass in Rotary
                    have expressed their anguish at the way some of our brethren
                    in India have been conducting the Rotary affairs.<BR>
                    <BR>
                    Reactions of the grass root Rotarian ranged from sorrow to
                    agreement with the views. It would be pointing out the
                    obvious when we say that great care needs to be exercised in
                    admitting members into the fold of Rotary. President
                    Jonathan has emphasized the family values of Rotary and
                    rightly so as a means of fostering a network of friendship
                    and fellowship.<BR>
                    <BR>
                    Talking of family, a Rotarian pointed out that we have the
                    head of the household, his wife, son, daughter-in-law,
                    daughter and son-in-law as Rotarians. Not surprising but
                    what is remarkable is that all of them belong to the same
                    Rotary club. Again this did not raise eyebrows until it was
                    revealed that the family is unwilling to admit outsiders
                    into the Rotary clubs as members! A true example of “All
                    in the family!”<BR>

                    “Auld Lang Syne”. Let us welcome 2004, the year that
                    will launch us into the Rotary Centennial. Wishing all the
                    Rotarians a glorious century.
