        <B>Why bother?</B><BR>
        <BR>
        I wonder at times about the advisability of writing a column when serving as editor.<BR>
        <BR>
        As a columnist you should have an independent view which you must not be apologetic about. The content should be such that it can be defended at all
        times.<BR>
        <BR>
        Of course the most important quality is topicality, readability and, in this case, relevance to Rotarians who are primarily the readers. This I have
        learnt is a painful process, easier said than done, but it is worth the effort. I record this not with a view to receive bouquets but solely to thank
        the many who read the column and respond, and many more who hopefully ponder over the message!<BR>
        <BR>
        <B>Criticism...</B><BR>
        <BR>
        A very senior Rotarian asked me whether we do publish letters to the editor that are critical of the magazine or the editor. I clarified that all
        letters critical of the editor are and will be published. As regards any criticism of the magazine or its contents, we do check whether it is justified,
        and exercise our discretion before publishing it. The rule we follow is not to attack individuals in any way or hurt their feelings. Bearing that in
        mind, we would like a healthy debate, or, if required, a no-holds barred discussion, on issues affecting Rotary ideals, or the propagation of Rotary
        values.

                <B>We have won the war!!</B><BR>
                <BR>
                Move over Bush and Saddam. The USA coalition (!) and Iraq can wait. Our own war with the neighbour occupies centrestage. While the political
                leadership urges caution in Iraq, we are all busy watching what has turned out to be the biggest “spectator-watched” war out on the turf in
                South Africa.<BR>
                <BR>
                The Prime Minister, who at his age should be in bed late at night, is wide awake cheering his favourite team (no prizes for guessing which one
                it is) to victory. The Finance Minister is in a jubilant mood; may be the defence background rules the heart rather than the economic portfolio
                that he holds now. Anyway it would appear to be a hopeless job trying to please the populace with a budget. So why not give a tax break to the
                heroes of the day, which should be good for a few votes from the cricket crazy? Even the Army Chief sent out congratulations to the team!<BR>
                <BR>
                Assuming that the 15 odd blue flannels will earn about Rs. 15 crores (I am sure that the actuals are much higher), Jaswant Singh has given away
                Rs. 5 crores for these people who will come back to the studios to do more commercials.<BR>
                <BR>
                Another question that springs to mind for investigation: were the families of soldiers who died in the real wars in Kashmir and Kargil given tax
                exemptions? What if the budget worsens the plight of the old, including my mother, and those living on a pension, which will be taxed or the
                returns reduced? Let us celebrate now.<BR>
                <BR>
                Looking through the Times of India, where page after page is devoted to cricket, I gathered that the India-Pakistan match saw a betting of over
                Rs. 4,000 crores. That is a huge sum in an illegal activity if ever there was one.<BR>
                <BR>
                My mind wandered to the US $80 million (Rs. 400 crores) - the funding gap for polio eradication that has been the talk in Rotary circles and is,
                I am sure, causing some furrow lines on the forehead of The Rotary Foundation Trustee Kalyan. If some good souls diverted a mere 10% from the
                betting to fund the gap in the war against polio, we as Indians would not have to hang our heads in shame at the widespread reports of polio
                outbreaks in northern India. Wouldn’t it be laudable if our cricketing heroes, who recently pledged their support to the polio cause, also
                donate the tax break towards polio eradication?<BR>
                <BR>
                The game will now compete with Bollywood, Kollywood, etc., going by the attire of the commentators, or the lack of it. A wag reported that
                Mandira Bedi could not sport the World Cup logo since there was hardly any apparel to tag the logo on to! The TV moguls have trivialised a
                gentleman’s game what with the intrusion of astrologers and Tarot card readers and advertisement breaks.<BR>
                <BR>
                Very soon we are bound to have UN intervention with inspectors scouring Shivaji Park, Feroz Shah Kotla, Eden Gardens and the Chinnaswamy
                stadiums to ensure that we are not surreptitiously cloning Sachin, Sourav, Sehwag, Yuvraj, etc. This may be the only way to stop a war breaking
                out between us and our neighbour.<BR>
                <BR>
                A knowledgable friend assures me that I am being paranoid because as a nation we are great spectators, willing to make a spectacle out of
                anything and everything, but if you ask one to get into the middle of the field into a war, then the whole crowd will vanish into thin air!<BR>
                <BR>
                Lastly a suggestion: A new subject should be taught at Rotary Peace Centres - Cricket Wars!<BR>
                <BR>
