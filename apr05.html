                Natural calamities are not uncommon. The pivotal role
		played by the NGOs is not uncommon either. But what made
		the agencies flabbergasted was the outpouring of
		individual contributions that followed the tsunami waves
		surge in the Indian Ocean. The Disaster Emergency
		Committee (DEC), formed by the people of UK, coordinating
		big charities&#146; tsunami appeals, raised 300 million Pounds
		(Rs.2640-crore).<BR>
		<BR>
		If you thought that people do not want to contribute
		anymore, then the DEC&#146;s act exploded that myth.	Polls
		conducted in different parts of the world showed that
		people under thirty years of age contributed more to the
		needy, thus scoffed the idea that young persons are more
		interested in video games and other such trivial things
		than helping the needy. <BR>
		<BR>
		During natural disasters, aid agencies are the first to
		reach the spot. Contrary to the convention, many private
		companies and individuals rushed to the tsunami affected
		areas and started rescue operations. Not only did they
		raise money but were also ready with relief measures
		within few hours of the devastation. By the time Rotary
		visited the affected areas, we had already missed the
		boat. There was no dearth of money or relief materials.
		The moral of the story is, that the voluntary
		organisations should evolve a disaster management
		methodology and ensure that they are able to rush to the
		spot and swing into action. <BR>
		<BR>
		Many private organisations including the media set up
		tsunami relief funds and collected huge amounts and they
		managed to disburse the same to the district authorities
		within hours of the natural fury. Individually, the 
		Rotarians of the affected areas have done a yeoman
		service, but collectively no impact was felt other than
		undertaking the rehabilitation work like providing
		makeshift tents and fishing boats to the affected
		fishermen. Maybe in days to come Rotarians will play the
		role.<BR>
		<BR>
		A disturbing trend is these days are the increasing
		numbers of non-official bodies/agencies entering the
		field of relief and rehabilitation, each one seeking to
		carve out space for itself. Many of them are fishing in
		&#145;Troubled Tsunami Waters.&#146; Their bona fides need to be
		verified, credibility established and numbers limited to
		ensure effective monitoring, implementation and the
		affected are not taken for a ride. It is here the
		relevance of reputed organisations like Rotary come into
		picture. <BR>
		<BR>
		Better late than never, we Rotarians have to set up
		corpus funds and collect money from willing donors and
		utilise it at the first instance of any eventuality. If in
		Britain, the people could form a DEC and collect a
		whopping sum of Rs.2640-crore, the service organisations
		like Rotary can do much more. Although, Rotary has evolved
		from a fellowship club to a higher pedestal of social
		service organisation, we need to evolve a methodology to
		formulate a disaster management plan in order to live up
		to our words, &#145;Service Above Self&#146;.<BR>

		<B><CENTER>What is news?</CENTER></B><BR>
		<BR>
		Our fellow Rotarians of Sri Lanka have a feeling that
		adequate coverage was not given about the tsunami
		devastation in Rotary News. We believe that this is not
		well founded as evidenced in the February and March 2005
		issues. Adequate coverage of the tsunami affected areas
		of Sri Lanka, coastal areas of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra
		Pradesh and the Andaman Islands is our aim.<BR>
		<BR>
		We are operating with a limited infrastructure, and
		depend upon Rotarians to keep us informed. <BR>
		<BR>
		To be fair, we do receive a lot of information of service
		rendered by Rotarians but the news worthiness of many is a
		debatable point.<BR>
		<BR>
		In the famous quote of John B. Bogart, &#145;When a dog bites
		a man, that is not news. But if a man bites a dog, that
		is news.&#146; <BR>
		<BR>
		Let me assure our readers that we don&#146;t want to bite, but
		we want to give you biting news.<BR>
