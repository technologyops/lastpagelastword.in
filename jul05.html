	     A NEW DAWN
	     </SPAN><BR><BR>
	     Stepping into the new century with a sense of de ja
		vue is like celebrating birthdays. They come and go and
		like time and tide no one can hold it back. But I must
		admire  RI President Carl Stenhammer?s dramatic
		exhortation - ?We will now write the first chapter of
		Rotary?s book on the second century?.<BR><BR>
		Generally speaking, history (looking back after time has 
		elapsed) can be beneficial and at times harsh. The history
		of Rotary in the first one hundred years will probably be
		now the subject matter of many studies. We await them.
		<BR><BR>
		<B>Have I got news for you  </B><BR><BR>
		What is a good news or report is becoming increasingly
		difficult to define. Having been an editor of Rotary News
		for little over a thousand days (a sort of Sathabishekam
		though not in years), I am pleasantly surprised that our
		readers have started noticing this magazine. Atleast to
		say what they like and do not like. To all at this
		organisation of Rotary in India, it is a milestone. 
		Admittedly, it is difficult to say what is good!<BR><BR>
 		In a recent article the eminent Jurist Soli. J. Sorabjee
		says:- Obscenity has defied an acceptable definition
		because of the subjective element in it. Despite umpteen
		attempts,there is no internationally acceptable definition
		of terrorism. Definition of minority has proved a
		Herculean task which has eluded legal luminaries.  So I
		derive solace whenever I come across a critical review of
		an article or the Rotary news magazine. In the words of
		T.S. Eliot:  <BR><BR>
		<SPAN class="summary">
		Words strain <BR>
		Crack and sometimes break<BR>
		Under the burden<BR>
		Under the tension, slip, slide, perish<BR>
		Decay with imprecision...  <BR>
		Trying to learn to use words <BR>
		and every attempt <BR>
		Is a wholly new start<BR>
		and a different kind of failure!  <BR></SPAN><BR><BR>

		Poverty and hunger are not popular issues with the
		political class and the third world debt is still less of
		an issue.For aid given by one set of contributors to be
		taken back in the form of interest repayments is generally
		seen as	theoretical.The proposal to cancel all the debts
		of 18 of the worlds poorest countries is evidence of
		change. And change has happened due to strong and
		sustained public pressure.Popular understanding of the
		vicious circle of indebtedness and poverty is far superior
		now to what it was a generation ago. It is in rich nations
		interest to be perceived as profiting from the poverty of
		another. Laws in many countries do not allow indenturing
		of labour - A father cannot borrow and commit his son to
		pay back. It is strange that nations are allowed to and
		commit their future generations to onerous debts. Surely a
		concern to be looked into. Here is an opportunity for
		Rotary to enter the centre stage in poverty alleviation
		and to live up to the theme-Service above self.<BR><BR>
