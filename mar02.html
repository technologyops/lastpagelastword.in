        Are they all alive? - That was the repartee of R I President Rick King, 
        when informed by a serving Rotary Governor that the Rotary membership in 
        his District has improved by a considerable percentage point during this 
        year of Global Quest!<BR>
        <BR>
        To understand this remark one needs to understand the background.<BR>
        <BR>
        Rotary International, in their goal of increasing the membership, has 
        promised awards (or rather rewards) to the District Governor and his/her 
        spouse when they beat all records to increase the membership. Fair 
        enough one would say - after all motivation is the key to success. But 
        those people at No. ONE, Evanston did not figure on the ingenuity of the 
        Rotarians here. So an enterprising Governor set about writing up a lot 
        of new membership report forms, and got the tickets pronto to the R I 
        Convention. On July 1 the membership figures dropped like a brick to the 
        ground.<BR>
        <BR>
        Some of the clubs were unhappy, the succeeding District Governor was in 
        deep distress (since he had to scale higher mountains from a mirage 
        height), and some Rotarians took it up with the higher ups.<BR>
        <BR>
        We understand that the highest authorities in Rotary are seized of the 
        matter of high reporting of memberships for rewards, coupled with the 
        low reporting of membership for the payment of Rotary dues!<BR>
        <BR>
        Now, tongue in cheek, let us look at a way to get to Barcelona 
        Convention as guests. That is at RI expense.<BR>
        <BR>
        The Global Quest programme requires the club to achieve a very high rate 
        of growth. The cut off date is 24 May 2002. Remember that no RI dues are 
        payable for Rotarians who join after 1 April 2002. The matter of 
        subscriptions to the District or the magazine can be handled locally. So 
        if a club shows a very high membership growth during April 2002 one 
        stands a good chance of seeing Spain at a minimal expense. But where do 
        we get the names? Well, a telephone directory could be one source ! <BR>
        <BR>
        To answer R I President Rick King, Yes, Sir, most of the new names 
        should be alive, as nobody would like to keep on paying the inflated 
        telephone bills here!<BR>
        <BR>

        YOUTH UNDER STRESS<BR>
        <BR>
        Rotary clubs are doing good work in schools and colleges with Interact 
        and Rotaract clubs. However most activities revolve around careers and 
        entertainment and RYLA’s. The Rotarians should turn their attention to 
        counselling the students to cope with stress. Stress is mostly related 
        to examinations and experts say that the burden of growing expectations 
        of family and friends are making students very, very nervous. So go on 
        Rotarians, don’t keep away from the youth thinking that they have no 
        time for you at this time of the year. This is the time they need the 
        soothing words most. <BR>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        SELF DISCIPLINE !<BR>
        <BR>
        At many fellowships the conversation eventually turns to the discipline 
        of queues and obeying of rules in Singapore or the many countries of the 
        West and how we fail on every count. Of course the culprits are not the 
        conversationalists but the so-called illiterate masses.<BR>
        <BR>
        Travelling to Delhi recently on the morning flight from Chennai you are 
        in the company of elite businessman clad in suits rearing to walk in the 
        corridors of power in Delhi for whatever is their vocation. Just 
        imagine, as soon as flight touched down in Delhi most of these power 
        people were up on their feet and opened the overhead lockers even before 
        the flight was in the parking bay. Couple of bags fell on the head of 
        the fellow flyers. The flight stewardess were pleading with all 
        passengers to sit down and reminding them that the seat belt sign has 
        not been switched off. Most people seemed in so much hurry and I was 
        reminded of the adage “time is money”. May be that is the reason I was 
        the last one to get off and go about my way!<BR>

        AWARDS !<BR>
        <BR>
        26th January besides being the Republic Day of India, also happens to be 
        the day when the honours are handed out to many richly deserving people 
        who have enriched our lives in one fashion or the other. The world of 
        arts and entertainment gets the fair share with a few political figures 
        thrown in. The share of honours for the non-governmental organisations / 
        service organisations continues to be sparse.<BR>
        <BR>
        The work done by Rotary in India with a truly federal organisation 
        working at grassroots is exemplified by the Polio Plus programme. 
        Somehow we in Rotary seem to have missed the eye of the powers to be who 
        dole out the Padma Bhushans and the Padma Vibushans.
