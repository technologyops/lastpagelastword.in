        </b><br>
        A new Rotary year begins. Let us wish ourselves- the 2200 + leaders, who don the mantle of leadership and the 80000 Rotarians of our Rotary zones, a glorious year of Service Above Self. The US Secretary of State Colin Powell is reported to have said “LEADERSHIP can’t be a popularity contest. Trying not to offend anyone, or trying to get everyone to like you, will set you on the road to mediocrity. Leaders who are afraid to make people angry are likely to waver and procrastinate when it comes to make tough choices. Being responsible sometimes means pissing people off. Your best bet people are those who support your agenda and who deliver the goods. If they don’t get what they expect and deserve, they become deflated and demotivated .” No harm in remembering some good advise like this !&nbsp;<br>

        <b>LITERACY MONTH&nbsp;</b><br>
        <br>
        JULY is LITERACY month. And I have often felt that this is not a priority of Rotarians in July. WHY? The Rotary clubs are busy in the change of leadership, getting the act together and finding the strengths and weaknesses. Then we are into August. For the populace in South Asia there can be no better long-term goal than full literacy.&nbsp;<br>
        Sitting in a public library in a suburb of London, using a free internet access to cull out information from around the world is a mind-blowing experience. And when in the next seat a 12 year old child is doing just, that  my heart aches for the children of India. Visiting Oxford in England, one feels the joy of learning in the bones. Over 800 years in pursuit of knowledge has its own charm. What have we missed out ? What happened to Nalanda, the famous university of yore and the Arthashastras of our lands - more ancient than Oxford? Would some enlightened Rotarians now blaze a path for our children ?<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>JOYS OF CHILDHOOD&nbsp;</b><br>
        <br>
        Watching a “Harry Potter....” movie I was amused that western cultures have now discovered magic and wizards. Lest one thinks that this is a flash in the pan, there are many more - “Artemi ..” etc., churning out novels that are lapped up by the children. A good way to boost the reading habit of the young minds. Tales of Vikramadhitya, Panchatantra and the epics come to mind but one is not sure whether it is the in thing with the children in India. Personally speaking, I am all for children dreaming and for Rotarians to dream with the children for a bright future.<br>

        <b>GET TOGETHER</b><br>
        <br>
        This is being written from Barcelona. The total cost to me is well over Rs 100,000/-. Wonder how many fellow Rotarians from our zone were there? About 300 people attended the Convention which is less than one half of one percent. All of us are concerned about costs in Rotary. RI have also urged us to look at ways and means of keeping the costs down. Would regional conventions be a possible solution? Convert summits and Presidential conferences to meets where the core Rotarian can be exposed to the new frontiers of service at a reasonable cost.&nbsp;<br>

        <b>EAST IS ROTARY</b><br>
        <br>
        Chairman Mao proclaimed “East is Red” long time ago. Opinions may differ on that quote but now the blue and gold Rotary wheel is prying open the bamboo curtain.<br>
        “The laws in China at present do not allow gatherings of more than thirty people as this is termed as a demonstration and jail ensues. Efforts are on to persuade the authorities to amend the law and allow Rotary clubs to start. At present there are two provisional Rotary clubs - Beijing and Shanghai - and these will not be chartered nor will extension ( of Rotary ) into China occur until the law is changed. If and when it does, the balance of power in the world will shift dramatically from the western hemisphere to eastern hemisphere. It will not be surprising if the change begins this Rotary year .”&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        These are not the wishful thinking of this writer but views and wisdom of Rotary International director Keith Barnard Jones ( from United Kingdom ) in a recent article in Rotary magazine of RIBI.<br>
        Are we ready for the exciting times ahead ?!<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>THE END OF THE BEGINNING</b><br>
        <br>
        Let me conclude the start of the Rotary year with another quote from Colin Powell :  “Whoever you are and whatever you do, someone out there is gunning for you. We therefore have to continually reinvent our jobs and make obsolete some or all of our accustomed activities before someone else does”.&nbsp;<br>
        Do you read me !<br>
