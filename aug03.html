        <SPAN class="subhead">Celebrate but how?<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        Writing in the month of August, this columnist is filled with trepidation.<BR>
        <BR>
        Once again it is time to plead with fellow Rotarians to stop the ostentatious installations of chair. Makes me wonder whether the leaders think that
        they are being crowned, a la the monarchs of England! Mind you, there have been some crowns made of flowers.<BR>
        <BR>
        I do not seem to be alone. Even bystanders are now beginning to notice the wasteful expenditure. A respected Tamil Nadu newspaper published a
        four-column story titled &quot;Is this showing off necessary,&quot; wondering whether we have become self-seekers.<BR>
        <BR>
        An outgoing President of Rotary Club expressed his gratitude by spending over Rs. 500 on a gift to each of the Rotarians (practically all members) who
        had helped him, for their selfless service. Doesn't the acceptance of this gift vitiate the selfless concept?<BR>
        <BR>
        A Governor of a state attending an installation function went on to remark that &quot;Rotary seems to be indulging in the old game of - you scratch my
        back, I scratch yours&quot; and also commented on the allied pomp and show. If this is the image we have been projecting to the community it needs to be
        reviewed with great urgency.<BR>
        <BR>
        Rotarians have been known to be insensitive to such criticism with the standard defence that it is 'service above self and not service without self.'
        But when the topmost constitutional authority of a state says in an open forum, in the full glare of the press, that 'back scratching' among Rotarians
        seems to be the order of the day, is it not time that we sit up and start cleansing the system? After decades of existence if the image of Rotary is
        still being debated, can we be complacent? Can we afford to start from scratch?<BR>
        <BR>
        Good Rotary friends are transported briefly and suddenly to stratospheric heights like a space shuttle, with a chronological account of their life from
        toddler to present day, leaving onlookers bemused. Such forms of back scratching to curry favours with the powers that be have only resulted in lowering
        the image of Rotary.<BR>
        <BR>
        Rotarians are unique - belonging to an association of professionals and business persons - who by their deeds of service demonstrate that they care for
        the community.<BR>
        <BR>
        Let us resolve to hand over the baton without the pomp that seems to be peculiar to this part of the world.<BR>
        <BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead"><B>Noor - Light Shines</B></SPAN><BR>
        <BR>
        A heart operation seems to have a struck a chord for peace more than many centres of studies of peace.<BR>
        <BR>
        Noor the toddler from Pakistan who underwent a major heart surgery in Bangalore has evoked the feeling of brotherhood (and sisterhood!) between the
        people of India and Pakistan.<BR>
        <BR>
        Noor's father probably echoed the feeling of the common man on both side of the border when he said, &quot;The problem of our countries is the
        politicians, the military and the MNCs who sell arms!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        Offers of help for Noor poured in from all sources and hopefully this will be the start of a new era of cooperation.<BR>
        <BR>
        The media hype was good to read but the writer was taken aback when India's national newspaper reported a promise from a Rotarian of Rs. 50,000 to fund
        Noor's surgery. We seem to be entering the league of politicians who make promises which the newspapers duly report. I hope this Rotarian has kept his
        promise and I hope that the newspaper reports this too.<BR>
        <BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead">More on Past Rotarians<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        Many people have written asking for information about the association of past Rotarians. This is based in London and details can be had by e-mail on : <A href="mailto:extension@past-rotarians.org.uk">extension@past-rotarians.org.uk</A>
        I do hope the people who seek this information are not in the process of forming one such association here!<BR>
        <BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead">Ethics<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        The item &quot;One is too many&quot; (Last Page Last Word, July 2003) seems to have struck a chord going by the responses in letters, e-mails and in
        person. It is in the nature of the world that when one hears and talks of one misdeed, many others now emboldened bring to the fore many more unpleasant
        violations of ethical behaviour in Rotary.<BR>
        <BR>
        Particularly shameful are the true (?) stories of misappropriation of monies meant for the community, contributed by our fellow Rotarians abroad and The
        Rotary Foundation. There is only one remedy to this virus. Show the exit to anyone who is mean enough to steal. Nothing short will do.
