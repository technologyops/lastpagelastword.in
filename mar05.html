       		<B>Scent of nostalgia!</B><BR>
		<BR>
		In her nine long years of her life, Malarvizhi has smelt
		it all. She remembers her first smell of the sea as a
		child. Her mother Kannagi used to carry her in her hip,
		helping her husband Kannan with the nets at night as he set
		out into the sea. <BR>
		<BR>
		Smell of fresh catch of fish early in the morning
		collection  for the market, smell of &#145;meen curry&#146; as
		Kannagi cooked for the exhausted Kannan, strong smell of
		Karuvadu (dried fish) on the nets for a rainy day, above
		all these, the overpowering scent of her mother as she
		hugged her green sari.<BR>
		<BR>
		Then, one day, the sea smelt strange. They ran as the
		sea level rose. Suddenly the giant waves lashed. The last
		words of Kannagi was &#145;Aiyo! Malar Vizhi.&#146;<BR>
		<BR>
		Smell of rotten bodies. They identified Kannagi by her 
		anklets. The smell of her mother&#146;s body burning and she can
		smell the &#145;meen curry&#146; now as she hugged her emotion
		drained father in the relief camp. But the smell is not the
		same. The smell of &#145;meen curry&#146; has changed forever. The
		only consolation was the scent of her mother as Malarvizhi
		hugged her mother&#146;s green sari, with nostalgia.<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>Where is the money?</B><BR>
		<BR>
		Is there money out there for a good cause? The answer would
		appear to be a resounding yes. A leading English daily with
		headquarters in the Southern India (the region most
		affected by the tsunami last December) received an
		unprecedented Rs12.50 cr. (US $2.841 million), all in a
		space of just two months. If the cause touches the heart,
		the hands open up is the message. The contributors cut
		across the whole section of the society - individuals,
		corporate houses, school children and association of
		persons - who have given expression to their compassion and
		solidarity with those affected. <BR>
		<BR>
		A noteworthy feature has been the scale of contributions 
		made &#145;online&#146;. Around 28 per cent of the total
		contributions came in through the Internet with the US, the
		UK, Australia, Singapore, Canada and the United Arab
		Emirates in the forefront. There was also significant
		contribution online from India. <BR>
		The Rotary leaders and the Rotarians may well draw a 
		lesson from this namely: tell the people the work that
		needs to be done - health issues, eradicating illiteracy,
		vocational opportunities for the unemployed and people will
		contribute. <BR>
		<BR>
		Ask and TAP, the door shall open!<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>HISTORY? What is it?</B><BR>
		<BR>
		In a recent bulletin I chanced to  come across a column by
		Rotarian C.Sivasubramaniam of Rotary club of Nagercoil
		Suburban, RI District 3210. Keen Rotarians must have come
		across his earlier books on Rotary.<BR>
		<BR>
		Rtn. C.Sivasubramaniam says &#147;I have requested all clubs
		through my editorial and article on &#147;History Speaks&#148; to
		send their history, But to my dismay I have not received
		the history of any club of our district&#148;. He adds, &#147;The
		writing of history, which is not an easy joke, requires the
		reconstruction of the past as nearly as it has really
		happened. The history of a Rotary club should bring out the
		events that highlight the achievements with some minimal
		reporting of members who made a research in the history of
		the club.&#148;<BR>
		<BR>
		An observer of Rotary may be left wondering whether history
		begins on July 1 and June 30 for many leaders of clubs /
		districts, looking at the way the lessons of past are
		ignored or the lack of consideration of the future when the
		baton is invariably passed on.<BR>
		<BR>
		CS also mentions the necessity of history jocularly in this
		couplet. &#147;Those who don&#146;t study the past will repeat its
		errors. Those who study it will find other ways to err&#148;.
		Here is a salute to Rotarian  <BR>
		<BR>
		C. Sivasubramaniam.<BR>
		Yes. We at Rotary News are hoping to do our bit to record
		the history of  Rotary in India . <BR>
		<BR>
		Can we get some volunteers please?<br>
