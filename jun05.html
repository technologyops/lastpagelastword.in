	     On the Centennial some introspection 
	     </SPAN><BR><BR>
	     What makes us tick? There has never been a more 	 
		powerful motivation in my life than to be a part of a
		group like Rotary. So what is exciting? To start with
		friends, I have been blessed with more and more friends
		every year. This singular facet of Rotary is the most
		unifying factor for all of us.<BR><BR>
		I enjoy the warmth and fellowship of newer faces. I have
		understood the myriad forms of service activities that we
		take up. The sheer pleasure of knowing that our club
		members and their families and the Rotary families at
		large can make you feel wanted, is a joy that can only be
		felt. The excitement of going to the project sites and
		working together as a team is an exhilarating experience.
		The words of happiness and the blessings of the
		beneficiaries of Rotary projects is a morale booster. 
		<BR><BR>
		Rotary has added more life into my years.So, if this is
		goodness what is the flip side? Again, it is some of the
		people who think Rotary is all fun. I dislike that
		thought. Making people do voluntary work is never easy for
		anyone. And it wasn&#146;t easy for me either. If people wanted
		to be in Rotary for personal gains and just exhibited
		their wealth, it made me unhappy. People who wrote cheques
		and listed them in a booklet full of projects made me
		wonderstruck at their attitude of service.  <BR><BR>
		People who try to take more than what they put into Rotary
		shock me. <BR><BR>
		People who just wanted to add more years to their life
		forgot to put life into Rotary; their life. <BR><BR>
		This becomes a life-threatening situation to many clubs,
		which fold up. This saddens me.<BR><BR>
		<B>My most exciting moment</B> - Well, this is the two
		long days of travel looking at Rotary&#146;s work in rebuilding
		Gujarat.<BR><BR>
		<B>My heros in Rotary</B> &#150; The senior leaders from India
		who have shaped Rotary into a fine organisation.<BR><BR>
		<B>My happiness</B> &#150; Being given an opportunity to be
		part of Rotary News Trust and to contribute to the growth
		of the Rotary News magazine and the trust.<BR><BR>
		Over to you &#133;   <BR><BR>

		A Wish Into The Next Century
		</SPAN><BR><BR>
		The Election Commission regulates elections in India and
		the process is widely recognised as being fair to all.
		Every country has its version of election commissions and
		regulatory body with varying powers and functions. In the
		UK such an organisation is almost non-existent. It was not
		till few years back that the Indian voter realised his or
		her rights as a voter and with the passage of time voters
		and contestants are being more and more educated. Former
		firebrand Election Commissioner TN Seshan gave the
		elections a new dimension and brought about the
		much-needed discipline in the whole process. It should be
		possible for Rotary also to have a mechanism which
		minimises, if not totally eliminates, the issues which
		dominate the elections to the office of the District
		Governor. It is comforting to note that the petitions
		challenging electoral results have drastically reduced in
		Rotary and the conflicts in Rotary are declining.<BR><BR>
		While many Rotarians are available to become the District
		Governors, a healthy sign of more people willing to take
		up responsibility, is the leadership development process
		at the club level being neglected? Leadership training
		programmes may have to be conducted more vigorously if we
		are to come up with people who will think globally to make
		our movement more vibrant and attractive to youngsters.
		This calls for more education and more transparent
		procedures.<BR><BR>
		The willingness shown now by many candidates to accept a
		verdict and join hands with the new leadership is a
		positive development. In the next century of Rotary we may
		have laid a strong base where elections are no more a
		event which create anxiety but a democratic process of
		selecting a friend who will lead us for a year.  <BR><BR>
		This change in mindset will remove the barriers between
		people and hopefully there will be no need for an election
		commissioner in Rotary.<BR><BR>
