        We all know that Sachin Tendulkar received a Ferrari car as a gift from racing champion Michael Schumacher. According to press reports, our
        Communications Minister, Pramod Mahajan, is attempting to waive the Rs. 2.5 crores to be paid as import duty by Sachin to bring the car home.<BR>
        <BR>I ask you, if a man with an annual income of Rs. 25 crores (according to media reports) does not pay this import duty, who should? And it is not as if
        it would be adding any value to him in his professional life as a cricketer in the Indian team.<BR>
        <BR>
        If Rotary Clubs were to import wheelchairs for disabled children, should not Mr. Mahajan help by exempting the import duty on them?<BR>
        <BR>
        That apart, I wonder what Sachin would do with the Ferrari. Surely our roads are not equipped to handle such a car. Perhaps the best he can do is drive
        it from Mumbai to Pune on the new highway and break the speed limits in the bargain!<BR>

        Coke did it. Pepsi did it too. But in this case, nobody said ‘Yeh dil mange more’ or ‘Life ho to aisi.’ It took a Supreme Court to issue a stern
        warning to these huge corporations.<BR>
        <BR>
        The Supreme Court also observed: “The message must go to all the state governments that they have a responsibility to protect our environment and
        forests, and they must be made accountable if there is any dereliction of duty.”<BR>
        <BR>
        This was on the occasion of imposing a punitive fine of Rs. 4 crores on corporates, including Coke and Pepsi, for defacing rocks along the Kullu-Manali
        Rohtang Pass by painting their advertisements on them. On top of this, to hide the names of the entities involved, crude methods were used to remove the
        ads, including hammers and chisels and rotary (no, not RI) grinding machines. This resulted in another Rs. 1 crore fine being imposed on the Himachal
        Pradesh government!<BR>

        I look around Chennai and I don’t see the trees. They are all hiding behind huge majestic hoardings amidst the traffic and the chaos that the city has
        become. Do you see any shrubbery or flowers? No, all you get to see are posters for every other movie including the semi-pornographic ones which seem to
        have a lot of voyeuristic value, or advertisement-posters for IT education, dotting the walls of our cities.<BR>
        <BR>
        As for the architecture in our neighbourhoods, today it seems to be mere gaudy paintings and neon lights lining the roads. This is sheer abuse of the
        open spaces that the average citizen should be able to enjoy without being subjected to avoidable visual pollution and squalor.<BR>
        <BR>
        Recently there has been a lot of hullabaloo about the dangers of using plastics in daily life (not that the undersigned promotes plastic pollution). But
        then there are plastics that are not of the polluting type. The same authorities ignore the other kinds of pollution caused by hoardings, dirtying of
        public spaces, etc.<BR>
        <BR>
        Without stretching the point, it can be said that fighting visual pollution too is vocational service. Making sure that one’s vocation does not
        impinge on one’s neighbours’ rights can go a long way in assuring that we are fulfilling the ideals of our vocation.<BR>
        <BR>
        Rotarians are professional and business people. We need to be sensitive to society and to also sensitize the society. Either we do it or out there
        someone will tell us to do it!<BR>
        <BR>
        <B>Who Reads Rotary Magazines?</B><BR>
        <BR>
        Waiting to board my flight back to India at the Cairns airport in Australia, I spied an elderly lady reading a magazine that seemed familiar. It turned
        out to be Rotary Down Under, the Australian Rotary magazine. I introduced myself to the lady, wife of Rotarian past president of a club in Sydney.<BR>
        <BR>
        We got talking and she told me that every time she travelled, she took old copies of the Rotary magazine with her to read as she did not get much time
        in her daily hectic schedule. After she had read them, she gave it to others she met during her journeys, who had not heard of Rotary. Here is an
        excellent method of propagating Rotary and its ideals, I thought.<BR>
        <BR>
        On a lighter note, she enquired about my stay in Australia, and among other things, I told her about my experiences travelling in a hot air balloon. It
        was an interesting “trip” – one seemed to have no control of where one was going – and there were a few hair-raising moments at the end of the
        trip when strong winds blew our balloon some 50 feet away and we landed in a water ditch. The lady, who had listened without interrupting me, then told
        me that her house was near the Sydney airport and they have had two unscheduled landings of hot air balloons in their courtyard recently!<BR>
        <BR>
        To end the story, the lady found me an Australian newspaper quipping that I must have had enough of Rotary magazines for a day. So on the return flight,
        I was reading a copy of the Australian, the national newspaper of Australia.<BR>
