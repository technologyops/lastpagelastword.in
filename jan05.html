               <B> City Of Joy</B><BR>
                <BR> 
               Travelling to “The City of Joy” – Kolkata for the uninitiated, is 
               always a beautiful experience, particularly in December with the 
               chill in the air.<BR>
               <BR>
               The visit to Kali ghat is a must for believers and I was there to 
               soothe my spiritual instincts. What added cream to the cake of 
               this experience was right next door. Missionaries of Charities 
               established by Mother Teresa – Nirmal Hriday – located nearby 
               is a real temple of service if ever there was one. The terminally 
               ill destitutes, most of them literally picked out from the streets 
               of Kolkata, were being cared for by the few volunteers as only 
               the genuine honest sincere ones can. The calmness with which 
               we were received and the self effacing manner in which the 
               carers described their service to the poor and ill tugged at the 
               hearts. As an editor I could not help but compare their manner 
               with which many of our fraternity clamour for publicity and do 
               occasionally take umbrage at not getting an exposure.<BR>
               <BR>
               The sight truly numbed the senses and one can only realize that 
               what we do is only a small step with miles still to go.<BR>
               <BR>
               A guide narrated a story, which in all probability is true. The story 
               line goes thus.<BR>
               <BR>
               “Some people who did not like Mother Teresa got a whole mob 
               together clamouring for closure of Nirmal Hriday. The police 
               fearing a law and order problem advised Mother Teresa to 
               close. After two or three such occasions the police chief told 
               Mother that she would have to close. She invited the Police chief 
               inside and said “If you and the people outside promise to look 
               after the inmates from now on I will leave”. The ashen faced police
               chief came outside and told the mob that Mother Teresa 
               will leave if the mob promise to look after the dying destitutes. 
               No prize for guessing what happened next. The mob vanished”.<BR>
               <BR>
               <B>Where is the 'Masla'?</B><BR>
               <BR>
               I wonder whether the regular readers of this column noticed a 
               difference in this issue. There is no mention of Rotary elections, 
               observations about club affairs and other bits of ‘masala’.<BR>
               <BR>
               However I do not promise to make this a New Year resolution. Hopefully
               the readers will approve.<BR>
               <BR>
               <B>Hungry Kya ?</B><BR>
               <BR>
               Driving down the road, my eyes fell on the rows of stalls selling 
               fruits of all varieties including imported ones. Trying to figure 
               out the quality of the fruits I am fond of, a chilling realisation 
               dawned on me. I am on a diet hopefully temporary, for the next 
               two months. Down the road at the signals were the inevitable 
               old woman and urchins begging for a morsel of food.<BR>
               <BR>
               Then I wondered what emotions these unfortunate humans go 
               through on seeing an elaborately decked display of exotic fruits 
               at the roadside stalls. Hungry kya? <BR>
               <BR>
               <B>A Resolution For the New Year</B><BR>
               <BR>
               Travelling they say broadens your view.<BR>
               <BR>
               My travel to Vishakapatnam, Andhra Pradesh for the Rotary 
               Foundation seminar proved to be an invigorating exercise.<BR>
               <BR>
               I had an opportunity to see the good work being done by the 
               Rotarians in the hospital of eye care named “Rotary Nethra”. 
               The story of the ups and downs, reaffirms our faith in the 
               Rotarians whose eyes were shining bright in the spirit of 
               service.<BR>
               <BR>
               The next one was the Rotary Blood Bank, a spanking bright 
               outfit established in the heart of the city solely by local 
               contributions. The standard of operations of the blood bank will 
               be the envy of many multinational corporations. Again the 
               patience and the approachability of our Rotary friends was a 
               striking one.<BR>
               <BR>
               These encounters  form  the basis of my first Rotary New Year 
               resolution.<BR>
               <BR>
               “Every place I go to, I shall make time to see the wonderful 
               service being rendered by fellow Rotarians”.<BR>
