        We in Rotary do believe in serving our senior citizens with PROBUS
        programmes etc. Generally the attitude is - I am afraid - sometimes
        patronizing. So it was a mind blowing experience to meet with an elderly
        lady who is sharp and enjoys interaction through teaching youngsters who
        are over 75 years younger than her. Meet Mary Drane West from
        Minneapolis, Minnesota ,USA.<BR>
        <BR>
        “Vibrant, vivacious, effervescent, kind hearted, soft-spoken. These
        adjectives could just go on and on and on…. They indeed signify the
        qualities of a woman who has made a mark in the field of music. Mary
        Drane West is no ordinary woman. She is 93 years old but young at heart.
        Her obsession for music could be traced back to her childhood days where
        she got interested in music at the age of 5. She learnt music and
        secretly taught her sister too. They astonished the family with their
        surprise performance. Thereafter they performed for the U.S. President
        Theodore Roosevelt. They played their best music-classical music.<BR>
        <BR>
        After her marriage to Bob West, Mary didn’t proceed with her interest
        until the age of 47. She and Bob had three children. At the age of 47,
        she discovered that her talent mustn’t go waste and that she must
        start teaching youngsters violin. She pleaded to one of the school
        conductor to send her one student as a test. Her reputation in fact
        spread like fire and her career was considered remarkable. She has been
        an associate professor at the University of Minnesota and has been
        interviewed by the media. She has also been honoured by the Greater Twin
        Cities Youth Symphonies and Schubert Club. The governor even declared a
        Mary West Day. Currently she works for the Macphail Center for the Arts
        and has no plans to retire.<BR>
        <BR>
        In fact she was successful in what she believed her strength was. Mary
        didn’t stagnate with only teaching violin. At the age of 72, she
        started to swim, that in turn helped her fight two-cancer surgeries. She
        also loves radical ideas, good conversations and her students, who keep
        her young all the time. Mary has always believed in living in the
        present and trying out novel things. Her idea in life is to practice and
        practice to achieve a state of perfection.<BR>
        <BR>
        At the age of 93, she teaches music because she has the potential and
        also since music is the love of her life. We in Rotary must write more
        about noble souls like Mary, who in turn would set an example for others
        to follow.”<BR>
        <BR>
        A salute to Mary.<BR>

        Traveling out of India, takes us a while to come to terms with many
        aspects and one of them that most of us ponder over is – money. A
        pound of tomatoes costs about Rs.90 in New York (US$ 2) and this fact
        makes it hard for an Indian to digest. What sounds wittier and shocking
        for an Indian is that the animals in Europe live in a bed of roses. It
        is rather amusing that every cow in European Union are given subsidies
        and are in turn in a better position compared to an average Indian. They
        are provided $2.50 a day (that is approximately Rs.112 a day), which is
        more than what 75 percent of Africans have to live on.<BR>
        <BR>
        Cows in Europe seem lucky compared to a most of the human beings around
        the world. Their owners are granted subsidies. What is rather hilarious
        is the fact that these cows are getting pampered. How about the 21
        million EU cows going on a round the world trip at least once a year
        with this kind of money. Seems humourous, doesn’t it? An ordinary
        Indian reading this piece of news would definitely be astonished. He
        would wonder that human beings in India are suffering due to poverty and
        on the other hand cows in Europe are getting coddled. If you feel that
        this is funny then what would happen to you, if you heard how much is
        provided to the Japanese cows. In fact the rate goes up for them and
        they are actually living an executive’s life. They are provided with
        $7.50 everyday making this an annual subsidy of US$ 20,000.(News item in
        the Times, London). Apparently it seems that they fly business class.<BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        Rotary in India must work towards the betterment of not only the human
        beings but also animals. There is no use if we only invest money into
        the health campaigns and helping the poor. What about our animals? Why
        can’t we provide them with the same kind of facilities that are
        provided to the European cows, so that they in turn would have a status
        of their own? And their masters would be better off too. India has a lot
        of potential, resources and infrastructure. Think about it and you would
        definitely be able to make a difference!<BR>
