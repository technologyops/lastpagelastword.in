        <B>A tale of two towns</B><BR>
        <BR>
        One of the pleasures of editing Rotary News is that one receives invitations to visit smaller towns and other cities. It was with slight trepidation
        that I accepted to visit the Rotary Club of Berhampur Silk City. The persistence of the President, Rtn. Srinibas Mahapatro, was the motivating factor
        for me to undertake the 18-hour journey to Berhampur. I suddenly discovered that I’ve been missing a lot. Gandhiji may have said that India lives in
        its villages but I can now confidently assert that Rotary clubs are more alive in smaller towns and villages than its brethren in the cities.<BR>
        <BR>
        The need for community development is everywhere. Going from a parched Tamil Nadu to a rain-drenched southern Orissa was in itself an experience, but I
        couldn’t but wonder why young women should be up early and fetching and carrying water to their homes from lakes and ponds. This early morning scene
        was repeated in village after village. Of course, I compare this to villages in Tamil Nadu where community water taps are aplenty (while there may not
        be water!). Another sorry sight I observed was children waiting outside schools at 9 in the morning – perhaps the teachers had not turned up.<BR>
        <BR>
        Coming back to the Rotary club, it was heartening to see many youngsters putting their heart and soul into improving the lives of the people in their
        community, and getting an enthusiastic response from the public and the local media.<BR>
        <BR>
        The other town I visited was Indira Gandhi country – Chikmagalur. A salubrious climate, a relaxed, easy-paced life, and the hard work at the
        plantations – all were evident in whomever we met in this town, which is the home of three Past District Governors of that area. Rotary philanthropy
        was manifest in the beautiful school hall that was constructed by Rotarians way back in 1967. This hall was the appropriate venue for the PETS/SETS
        organised by DGE Surya Prakash Bhat, RI District 3180. Again the Rotarians from the rural area scored over their urban cousins. Over 200 Rotarians
        proved to be a very attentive, disciplined and interactive audience. It is experiences such as these that make all of us proud to belong to Rotary.<BR>

        I had occasion to meet a Rotarian of 39 years standing, a Past District Governor and a true gentleman. During my one-day interaction with him, I found
        him to be full of ideas and possibilities, with a very positive outlook. His comments about Rotary News were not superficial, having been thought over,
        analysed and stored for delivery at an appropriate time.<BR>
        <BR>
        Probing him selfishly, I asked him for his Rotary reminiscences. He simply picked up his club directory and then and there recited the history of his
        club, right from the first President, an L.J. McIver in whose name a township stands in the outskirts of the city; to another president after whom a
        road has been named, and yet another who had to resign from the presidentship halfway through due to extra-marital dalliances. He went on about each
        president and his contributions.<BR>
        <BR>
        I said, “Sir, it’d be a pity if we lose some of the history like we have lost much of the contributions of the Rotarians in South Asia, merely
        because these were not documented or publicised adequately.”<BR>
        <BR>
        That was my plea to Past District Governor M. Srinivas Rao, a doyen among Rotarians and a thorough gentleman from the Rotary Club of Bangalore, RI
        District 3190. <BR>

                <B>Antique Lost<BR>
                </B><BR>
                It was with a heavy heart that I learnt that the Rotary Club of Bangalore lost an ivory gavel with an engraving of the Rotary wheel. The gavel
                is a unique piece of history, presented to the club by the Rotarians of the Rotary Club of Madras, the sponsoring club, during the presentation
                of the charter way back in 1934. Notwithstanding the monetary value of the gavel, I believe it is an invaluable and special part of our history.
                If anybody has any information about this gavel or about similar old and rare Rotary artifacts or memorabilia, please do write in to Rotary News
                or email us at <A href="mailto:rotarynews@rotaryindia.net">rotarynews@rotaryindia.net</A>. We would love to publish about and publicise these
                antiques. <BR>
