 <!--<img border="0" src="aboutUs/fiftyYearsSmall.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="200" height="100" align="right">-->Many friends wonder what purpose is served by a Rotary magazine. Most feel, grudgingly, that a flyer listing some internal titbits, a sort of a house magazine is okay, but wonder why we need a monthly magazine, a fullfledged one at that.<br>
 <br>
 The answer is, “We are different.”<br>
 <br>
 Rotary News is a magazine that is different when compared to others, say India Today, Outlook, The Week, etc.</font>
 <P ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">How?&nbsp;<br>
 <br>
 We are the GOOD NEWS magazine.<br>
 <br>
 Our mission is to communicate with the world communities the spirit of goodwill spread, and service rendered by the dedicated band of 1.2 million men and women known as ROTARIANS.<br>
 <br>
 Our role is not to sensationalise human tragedies, man-made or otherwise, but to report the response of ROTARIANS to the needs of the community.<br>
 <br>
 Our hope is to “Kindle the Spirit Within” each human being to “Look Beyond Yourself (themselves).”<br>
 <br>
 These ideals have stood the test of time. Our efforts are being appreciated by the growing 70,000 readership. And that is how this magazine, Rotary News, has been successful and completed 50 years of publication.<br>

 <P ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>A debt of gratitude</b><br>
 <br>
 Many accolades have been received by the Editor but the real heroes are the people who put their heart and soul into bringing out Rotary News every month.<br>
 <br>
 I would be failing in my duty if I did not thank P. Sethu, P.V. Laxminarayana (our auditor) and T.V. Kailasam for their unstinted support, having contributed many man-hours, helping the undersigned without expecting any reward. On board we now have an Executive Editor, Vidya Sigamany, who has shouldered the bulk of the work of the 50th anniversary issue. The staff, in particular Mr. T.S. Dharanipathy, Mr. K. Viswanathan, Mr. K. Venkatesan and others, have diligently worked to make Rotary News production and administration a model one. The translators, Hema and Narayan Das, have tried their best to adapt to the multifarious needs of our Hindi readers.<br>
 <br>
 The trustees, Executive Committee members, RI Directors and PRIP Raja Saboo have all guided us with suggestions and wholehearted support.<br>
 <br>
 Finally to our readers, who by their appreciation have motivated us, our heartfelt thanks.<br>
 <br>

 <P ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Looking Back</b><br>
 <br>
 Oddly enough, it is 50 months since the undersigned took over as the Editor of Rotary News. Sitting in the saddle, one cannot help being overawed by the hard work put in by my predecessors and those who assisted them.<br>
 <br>
 Debu Hosali was indeed a pioneer who braved many obstacles, including financial constraints to bring out Rotary News for over 25 years. His vision did not fail.<br>
 <br>
 Panduranga Setty, ably assisted by Madhura Chatrapathy, continued the publication with renewed vigour and brought in many new features. A cartoon type book produced by the two on the life and times of Paul Harris is a collector’s item.<br>
 Jyotindra Vakil brought in colour to Rotary News during the magazine’s sojourn in Bombay.<br>
 <br>
 Viswanatha Reddy’s stewardship saw a dramatic rise in circulation; he also initiated a formal structure of overseeing the magazine.<br>
 <br>
 I am, of course, fortunate to inherit this legacy on the 50th year of publication of Rotary News. The last four years saw a 40% increase in circulation in keeping with the expansion in membership. Financially we are stable and have acquired our own premises to serve the Rotarians of South Asia, and to cater to the needs of Rotarians, by providing them information on Rotary, both in print and electronic formats. This centre would also serve as archives and will have a library.<br>
 <br>
 Future: With 50 years of achievement behind us, we now look forward to Rotary’s Centennial in 2005. With the hope of serving further, I thought of identifying the goals for Rotary News, and for myself, as Editor on this historic occasion:<br>
 <br>
 1. 	To report Rotary activities and promote Rotary programmes to the Rotarians in our region.<br>
 2. 	To resist the blandishments of ambitious Rotarians who seek personal publicity in the magazines for their own advancement.<br>
 3. 	To guide the thinking of our governing bodies so that they make only the correct decisions.<br>
 4. 	To loyally support the Rotary Press Corps in opposing any interference in editorial practices or any restriction on editorial freedom by the hierarchy.<br>
 <br>
 I must confess that these goals are not new.&nbsp;<br>
 <br>
 Actually they were adopted by the founding editor Debu Hosali almost 25 years ago, and they still hold good!</font>
