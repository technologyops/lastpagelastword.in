        <B>Lady Governors do make a mark!</B><BR>
        <BR>
        I have wondered at the profligate use of space in GML’s (Governors
        monthly letter) listing out the Rotary District conference resolutions.
        Almost all of them turn out to be a long list of thank you’s.
        Obviously this may not be of any use as information to many. Many
        GML’s reproduce the RI President’s message too which also appears in
        print in “The Rotarian” / Rotary news / Rotary Samachar. But DG
        Kawal Bedi of R I District 3080 reports of two conferences resolutions
        which I liked.<BR>
        <BR>
        1. The annual conference of District 3080 at its session held on Sunday
        February 8th 2004 hereby resolve unanimously that “the decision taken
        at the meeting of college of Governors excluding that part which my be
        deemed confidential or sensitive be made know through circular of
        Governors monthly letter to the clubs in the district. Further resolves
        to thank the district Governors and the past Governors for agreeing to
        do so”.<BR>
        <BR>
        2. The annual Conference of District 3080 resolves that “the
        nominating committee for selection of the Governor nominee should meet
        within 24 hours of the announcement of the formation of the committee
        and should proceed with completing the task of selecting the Governor
        nominee of the relevant year. Further the District Governor should take
        necessary action to have the bylaws of the district amended together
        with the schedule of dates as per the provision at the earliest next
        opportunity to give effect to this resolution”.<BR>
        <BR>
        A blow for transparency and meaningful dissemination of information.<BR>

        As an editor we are destined to find the punctuation errors after the
        magazine is printed.<BR>
        <BR>
        But then do many people really notice it? Here is a story from the book
        “ The Zero tolerance approach to punctuation” by Lynne Truss<BR>
        <BR>
        “A Panda walks into a café. He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws
        a gun and fires two shots in the air.<BR>
        <BR>
        “Why?” asks the confused waiter, as the panda makes towards the
        exit. The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses
        it over his shoulder.<BR>
        <BR>
        “I’m a panda,” he says, at the door. “Look it up.”<BR>
        <BR>
        The waiter turns to the relevant entry and, sure enough, finds an
        explanation.<BR>
        <BR>
        “Panda. Large black and white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats,
        shoots and leaves.”<BR>
        <BR>
        So, punctuation really does matter, even if it is only occasionally a
        matter of life and death.”<BR>

        It is that time of year when the RI President Elect, District Governors
        and the Club Presidents choose men and women for different tasks. Not
        infrequently this process causes a lot of heartburns. I am reminded of a
        couplet from Tirukkural in Tamil written over 2000 years ago.<BR>

        (Translated this reads<BR>
        “The nature of the job, the suitable man and the appropriate time,
        should all be considered before embarking on the enterprise.”)<BR>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        <!--<IMG border="0" src="66-b.gif" width="289" height="45">(517)<BR>-->
        <BR>
        (Translated this reads<BR>
        “Having examined and decided that this job could be competently done
        with these means by this person, he may be left to do it on his own.”)<BR>
        <BR>
        What was said then, holds true now.</P>

        Remember the southern superstar Rajnikanth’s film Badsha? The very
        famous song “Naan Autokaran” (I am an auto rickshaw driver) was in
        the lips of many for a long time. One wondered if there were any auto
        rickshaws drivers who were so helpful as the verses claimed. Well, now
        we have seen one. Rotary club’s annual association with autorickshaws
        begins and ends with the PolioPlus propaganda on the NIDs. In many
        places, the propaganda materials which reach the District Governor’s
        office weeks before the NIDs are collected by the clubs barely 24 hours
        before the NID. With two more NIDs being added this year some clubs seem
        to have lost the energy even to visit the District Governor’s office
        to collect the materials. A noble auto rickshaw driver collected the
        materials on behalf of a Rotary club whose members were too busy (or
        tired?) even to stir out of the cool comforts of their offices or homes
        in the waterless summer. The auto driver and his son, a tiny tot, who
        were loading the materials into the autorickshaw, seemed happy to
        “Lend a Hand” to the Rotarians!</P>
