        <SPAN class="subhead">Arch Klumph Fellow?<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        When this column featured a write-up on Arch Klumph Fellow we seem to have tread unwittingly on a few toes. But then many Rotarians from all over India had wanted to know RI's opinion on the practice of districts conferring Arch Klumph Fellows. Hence we requested PRIP James Lacy and now the chairman of the Trustees of The Rotary Foundation  for guidance on awarding such recognitions. Jim Lacy had asked John Osterland, General Manager of The Rotary Foundation to respond to our query. Here is what John Osterlund, has to say:<br>
        <br>
        <i>"...the prominence of the name Arch Klumph is more deserving than to be utilized for lesser dollar amount contributions. The Trustees have historically safeguarded the name of Arch Klumph for apppropriate use. With The Rotary  Foundation's centennial approaching in 2017, it is envisaged that the Klumph name will be utilized extensively for this purpose.<br>
        <br>
        We are keen ... to recognize and encourage more Rotarians to support the Foundation, but we respectfully ask that you do so without the advantage of Arch Klumph's name."</i><br>
        <br>
        The case now rests.<BR>
        <BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead">The Naming Game</SPAN><BR>
        <BR>
        What's in a name? Well, I lived in simple times and I had it rather easy working that out. But in the far more complex times now we have to deal with situations where names are a combination of many factors.<br>
        <br>
        The pangs of naming a new born baby is known to every parent. But naming a new Rotary club is easy. Just add the likes of these suffixes to the name of the city or town and you have a name - "Meera, Priyadarshini, Metropolitan, Sakthi, Millennium, Health City, Sea Face, Sunrise, Round Town, Silver Beach, Milk City, Aaditya, Cosmos or Galaxy."<br>
        <br>
        Have you tried to pinpoint the location of clubs with these names in a city? It is curious the way English terms are tagged to the names of cities and the way they find acceptance with RI. Professions at times turn into names like Lakdawala and Daruwala. Hope these don't get attached as well.<br>
        <br>
        The Manual of Procedure of RI states that 'A club is to identify with its locality and the community it serves. The name should be easily identifiable on a map of the area&#8230;'<br>
        <br>
        With territorial rights now abolished, may be it is time that such rules of RI which have lost their relevance today be changed accordingly.<br>
        <br>
        Rotary, like a rose, by any name will smell as sweet and serve the community.<BR>
        <BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead">Promises to Forget...?<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        Do you remember Aastha, the billionth baby of India? The media splash about baby Aastha who was born on May 11, 2000 including the visit of a Union Minister who visited her at the hospital may not be remembered by many.<br>
        <br>
        What the situation is three years later was apparent from a newspaper article. The state of our social concern is laid bare when Aastha's mother says: "Six months after Aastha's birth, a doctor from Safdarjung Hospital came to see her. Since then nobody has bothered to enquire about her well-being." A promise of a better job for Aastha's father by another Union Minister is yet to be kept.<br>
        <br>
        Aastha herself, shy in the presence of strangers, looks on in bewilderment - little minds can never comprehend why promises are made to be broken almost immediately!<br>
        <br>
        If the lay reader is wondering at the reason for this attention in Rotary News, it is because of the editorial that appeared in your magazine in July 2000. The editorial laments at the fact that Aastha seems to be getting the world's attention while many more children  are left to their fate. We have been proved wrong ! We treat all childrens equally poorly!<br>
        <br>
        Surely a thought for the New Generations month.<BR>
        <BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead">Mirch Masala<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        Driving in the city with the radio on, one is compelled to listen to the incessant chatter of a female disc jockey. While one tolerates the music depending on one's taste, what was interesting was the issues being tossed up for discussion amongst youth in this particular channel. The question of the day was - should cattle be allowed to roam freely in the streets of our cities and towns and remain as holy cows, or should they be removed to colonies outside these areas. You'd think that the issue of hygiene and city/town living would cry out against these unauthorised campers. The response from many of the youth was, to say the least, amusing. One youth wanted the government to provide alternate sites, another wanted the government to take over the cows and a third felt that the cows can be housed in each home. You can't blame me for losing heart in the new generation. It is then that I realised that sexed-up chatter that is so much part of the dumbing down prevelant in today's media, is exactly that - chatter, chatter and nothing more. I'll still place my bet on the new generations to rise above such trivia and not be taken in by the temporary hot state of the mirch masala.
