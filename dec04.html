		<B>A Very Happy 2005 <BR>
		To All Readers Of This Column</B><BR>
		<BR>
		Let me end the year 2004 with the fervent hope that the New
		Year 2005, which will bring us to the centennial year and
		month and day of Rotary’s existence, will be a better one.<BR>
		<BR>
		If the readers detect a sense of despondency, they are right.
		After all, the Rotarians in India have received a jolt from
		The Rotary Foundation trustees during the last 4 months. More
		than anything else, the psych of most Rotarians has been
		hurt. But I am happy to note that the same Rotarians have set
		about setting things right. The efficiency with which eight
		RI Districts have cleared the clouds of cobwebs in their TRF
		grants is to be applauded. I cannot but feel that the other
		Districts need to pull up their socks. Wonder what is holding
		them back?!<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>New year resolutions!</B><BR>
		<BR>
		It will be nice if three Resolutions can be adopted by every 
		Rotarian for 2005:<BR>
		<UL type=" ">
		<LI>I shall participate in ‘Every Rotarian, Every Year’ programme 
		of The Rotary Foundation;
		<LI>In the year 2005, I (along with my fellow Rotarians) shall strive
		to elect the district governor by consensus and not by an election;
		<LI>I shall participate in at least one Rotary project to serve the 
		community.
		</UL>
		Of course, I would like to hear of other resolutions of
		Rotarians in the centennial year.<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>Impressions</B><BR>
		<BR>
		Recently, I went along with my better half, of course, on a
		fellowship tour organised by a Rotary club. Mind you, the
		cost ran to two instalments of Rotary Foundation Sustaining
		Membership for the three-day fun. I must confess that the
		fellowship was extremely good and the opportunity for young
		Rotarians to interact with the sixty-plus provided ample
		opportunities to gain an insight into what will be the
		expectations of the leaders of tomorrow. So what is the rub?
		Somehow I did not  get the impression that my fellow
		Rotarians were enthused by The Rotary Foundation or the
		advocates of TRF. The Rotary Foundation district officers are
		generally looked upon as ‘collectors’  rather than
		‘facilitators’. In the centenary year, there appears to be a
		need to reinvent the advocacy of The Rotary Foundation.<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>Surrogate</B><BR>
		<BR>
		Rotary rightly frowns upon cheque-book charity. This
		antipathy also extends to ‘surrogate’ projects, meaning,
		projects executed by others for which credit is sought by the
		Rotary clubs or individuals. <BR>
		<BR>
		I wonder at the mindset of so-called educated persons
		occupying positions in the corporate world. Look at the
		liquor advertising. The Government has banned this in
		hoardings (bill boards), magazines and newspapers for right
		reasons. Yet, we witness the disgraceful act of the producers
		who advertise the same products with same name claiming that
		they are peddling sodas, glasses, et al. Don’t tell me that
		the highly paid copywriter’s hands are clean. <BR>
		<BR>
		Are we transplanting the same culture into Rotary activities
		in interpreting the laws? Let us call a spade a spade, and
		not smirk when some one attempts to be too clever by half. <BR>
		<BR>
		<B>Accountability</B><BR>
		<BR>
		In a recent interview, Mr. N.R.Narayana Murthy, Chairman,
		Infosys, was quoted as saying in response to challenges in
		India’s democracy, “Accountability is the greatest challenge.
		Our leaders are accountable to whom? They should be
		accountable to the people....We have 500 million illiterates,
		700 million without sanitation. If this is not lack of
		accountability, what is?” The talking mirror in me was struck
		by the applicability of the saying to Rotary affairs too in
		the context of the District Elections and the Rotary
		Foundation affairs.<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>Are you going bald?</B><BR>
		<BR>
		Do you know that a study has indicated that “Proportion of
		men earning more than $8000 per month who complain that they
		are losing their hair, is 95% while proportion of men earning
		less than $1000 per month who complain that they are losing
		their hair is 35% only?” (Source Humanscape: November 2000.
		Compilation by Anoop Babani). So why not give away some money
		for a good cause in Rotary and keep your hair?<BR>
