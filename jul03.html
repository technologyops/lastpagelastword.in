        <SPAN class="subhead">Calendar girls<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        Fundraising as a subjectis not well understood. Some methods turn controversial. Here is a novel and funny one that did not start that way.<BR>
        <BR>
        This is a true(ish) story of a calendar with photographs of middle-aged ladies from Yorkshire, UK &#8211;ladies of the Rylestone Women&#8217;s Institute &#8211;who
        stripped for a parody of the much sought after Pirelli calendar to raise money for leukemia research and inadvertently became worldwide stars.<BR>
        <BR>
        The calendar girls&#8217; story started in 1999 as a bit of fun to raise money after the early death from leukemia of Angela&#8217;s husband, John Baker. It was
        Tricia, Angela&#8217;s oldest friend, who came up with the idea of their posing naked for the calendar in the hope of raising maybe £ 1000 to buy a new
        sofa for the visitors&#8217; room at the local hospital.<BR>
        <BR>
        The 12 members of the Women&#8217;s Institute (WI) posed with a string of pearls with the traditional accoutrements of the WI &#8211; jam pots and needlework
        &#8211; strategically placed to spare their blushes. The pictures were taken by the husband of Miss July, a former director of an advertisement agency.<BR>
        <BR>
        Local businessmen sponsored 3,000 copies, far more than they expected to sell. But the novelty caught on and the Rylestone ladies outsold pop star
        posters. The calendar raised nearly £ 600,000 and funded a leukemia unit at the hospital.<BR>
        The story is now being made into a movie!<BR>
        <BR>
        Makes me wonder whether we have a local story to report?<BR>
        <BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead"><B>One is too many</B></SPAN><BR>

        There are about 650 Rotarians in India who are senior members having occupied high-ranking positions in Rotary. Lately I have heard and read some
        disturbing news. In one case, a Governor has been served with a termination notice. This is certainly shocking and unsettling.<BR>
        <BR>
        The senior Rotarians should act as role models of probity, integrity and leadership for the rest 95,000 Rotarians of our zone. If even one of them is
        found lacking or shirking his responsibility, then it reflects on the total body. We cannot dismiss it or tolerate it as just one case. It is also
        important that, as a wise person remarked, &#8220;Not only the offender but the people who put him in the position are to be blamed.&#8221; In these times when
        rumours of manipulation of elections are rampant, this is another factor to keep in mind.<BR>
        <BR>
        PRIP Rtn. Herbert Brown said in 1995, &#8220;I dream of a world where the word Integrity becomes as essential as the air we breathe and the water we drink.
        Integrity is living what we profess to believe, to act as we promise, and to be true to our word. It means to perform to the letter and faithfully to
        the spirit what we have committed to do.&#8221;<BR>
        <BR>
        Here is a fervent plea, as we approach our Centennial year, for the leadership to rise like a phoenix, and get ready to serve afresh.<BR>
        We can&#8217;t have even one rotten apple in the bag. Even one is too many.<BR>
        <BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead">Past Rotarians? where are they?</SPAN><BR>
        <BR>
        The month of July is here. When you walk into the regular club meeting, you miss some of the old familiar faces. On enquiry, you are told that these
        Rotarians have now discontinued their membership and you miss the fellowship.<BR>
        <BR>
        It was a pleasant surprise to find that there is an association of past Rotarians in the United Kingdom. The Association of Past Rotarians was formed in
        1960 at the Rotary House of Friendship, London and now has 40 odd clubs. It also appears that the members meet regularly.<BR>
        <BR>
        Considering the substantial number who leave our organisation, this may give us a way to keep in touch with them. May be we can also find out why they
        decided to leave Rotary?!<BR>
        <BR>
        <SPAN class="subhead">Thank You<BR>
        </SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
        I would be failing in my duty if I did not acknowledge the tremendous contribution made by Past RI Director Dr. P.C. Thomas in the last two years of his
        active association with Rotary News Trust. The progress made by Rotary News Trust in magazine content and property acquisition would not have been
        possible without his encouragement and unstinted support. I look forward to his continued support as a Rotary News Trust Advisor.<BR>

        PDG Asoke Ghosh has been associated as an Executive Committee member for the last three years and has played an active role in supporting the magazines.
        PDG C. Srivatsan, Executive Committee member whose term ended June 30 2003, brought his wealth of experience as a Chartered Accountant in ensuring that
        the affairs of Rotary News Trust were always on track.
