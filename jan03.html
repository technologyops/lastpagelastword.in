        Then I woke up and realised that this was 1st of January 2003 and all thoughts were passing dreams of the night.<BR>
        <BR>
        Nay, these are the wishes for the year 2003.<BR>
        <BR>
        Here is hoping that all of them come true

        <P><B>New Year Resolutions - inspiration from Rajaji</B><BR>
        <BR>
        One event that is usually on my schedule on the 1st of January every year is the resolutions for the New Year. But after I went through an article about
        Rajaji, the futility of wanting more was acutely felt.<BR>
        <BR>
        We have heard about Rajaji's intellectual prowess, his role in the freedom movement and his achievements in the political arena. But this article talked
        about his personal tragedies - losing his wife when he was only 37 and their youngest child at only 3, and the death of his beloved son and both
        sons-in-law in their prime during his lifetime. In spite of these ordeals, Rajaji maintained a calm. His brilliant intellect, steadfast conviction in
        his beliefs and his courage in speaking the truth at all times was what the masses saw in him - and made him a great leader to be respected and revered.
        However he suffered a lot of political setbacks and public humiliations; and he was neglected for a large part of his political career.<BR>
        <BR>
        The article highlighted a Tamil verse composition penned by Rajaji, &quot;Kurai Onrum Illai,&quot; meaning &quot;I don't have any complaints or
        regrets.&quot; It is a beautiful composition in which Rajaji thanks the Almighty for all that He has blessed him, with not blaming fate or anybody for
        the blows life had dealt him. In fact, he is happy and thankful for all the good things that have come his way.<BR>
        <BR>
        Isn't this an example for us to learn from this great man? Why do we keep seeking more for ourselves? Why do we blame God or others when we don't get
        what we want? We have to realise that we ourselves are the source of our happiness and our problems. Inner peace can be experienced only when we take
        things in our stride and are satisfied with whatever we are. Ultimately one should be able to say, &quot;I'm happy,&quot; rather than &quot;I'm
        successful,&quot; or &quot;I'm wealthy.&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        This is my New Year resolution for 2003, thanks to Rajaji.<BR>
