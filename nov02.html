        It is always an exhilarating feeling to meet the new batch of Governor-Elects. The undersigned had the opportunity to meet the bright-eyed confident
        class of 2003-2004, courtesy our R.I. Director-Elect Sushil Gupta. I must confess that this class feels like a group that will lead Rotary in India very
        well indeed.<BR>

        <B>Values and ethics</B><BR>
        Justice Verma, speaking at the above meet, said that we should draw inspiration from our past leaders. He said that Pandit Nehru, Sardar Patel and his
        colleagues used to describe themselves as servants of the public (the masses). Now we have a breed of politicians who are busy denying that they are
        public servants to avoid the rules applicable to public servants. Such are the values and ethics systems of today.<BR>
        <BR>
        Rotary can be most enjoyable if only we can avoid problems arising from elections. I hear that courts of law are now being dragged into matters such as
        the nominating committee, leave alone the elections of governors. It is usual to blame the Past District Governors for their state of affairs, but I am
        afraid that the District Governors are also putting their “paddle into the brew.”<BR>
        <BR>
        A friend of mine, who has so far successfully resisted my invitation to join Rotary, remarked, “I thought Rotary is a non-profit organisation. But the
        way some people are fighting the Rotary elections, one begins to suspect that there is more to Rotary benefits than meets the eye.”<BR>
        <BR>
        My head hangs in shame.<BR>
        <BR>
        November is synonymous with Rotary election fever.<BR>
        <BR>
        Talking of contests in courts, the undersigned had the privilege to witness an election case - albeit a non-Rotary one. I am sure you will appreciate
        the ridiculous extents to which they can go!<BR>
        <BR>
        I had waited in the court for close to three hours for a case to be heard. It was a simple succession case attestation, which was not expected to take
        more than 20 minutes. Along with us there was a young couple waiting with a three-month-old female child that they wanted to adopt. That was when we
        witnessed this outrageous case where the Trustees of the one of the well-known colleges - some from the Old Boys Club were literally fighting it out in
        the court. There were large groups of noisy supporters, mostly lawyers for each candidate. As we watched in amazement, the case developed into a
        full-scale cinema-like “court scene” with legalese being thrown around, with lots of nitpicking, dueling and verbal sparring from both sides.<BR>
        <BR>
        On enquiry I was told that for over six years in a row, the administration of the elections to the Trust had been given to a court-appointed advocate!
        It was hard to believe that these supposedly civilised citizens were resorting to such petty quarrels, and consequently wasting the time of the court
        and people with genuine cases. The election seemed nothing more than a clash of personal egos.<BR>
        <BR>
        The whole situation became unbearable even for the baby waiting to be adopted as it started howling in the midst of the overall pandemonium! It seemed
        to be protesting at being kept waiting at the most important moment in its life – where as an abandoned girl child, it was just about to get a new
        home and life.<BR>
        <BR>
        After more than two hours of squabbling and bickering, the hearing was over. The tired judge looked at us as if wondering whether we could come back the
        next day. The couple’s lawyer – a plucky lady – persuaded the judge to take up our cases, which were completed soon.<BR>
        <BR>
        To what ridiculous depths the elections and the aftermath can go is a lesson for us Rotarians to learn.<BR>
        <BR>
        To conclude on values and ethics, here is an anecdote.<BR>
        <BR>
        A panel of senior judges was discussing the merits of some judicial officials (magistrates) for promotion to the next level. Discussion on one candidate
        started with a stoic silence, since it was generally known that the candidate was a standing example of “Peter principle” (to put it mildly, the
        principle states that a person rises upto a level just above his total competence). Then one of the panelists said, “Well, at least he (the judge) is
        honest! So let us give it to him!!”<BR>
        <BR>
        Lest anyone think that I invented this, let me assure the readers that this is straight from one of the highest judicial chairs in the country.<BR>
